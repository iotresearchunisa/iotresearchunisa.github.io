	abstract = {Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be. In this work we investigate the possibility to determine when the earthquake will take place.

We formulate the problem as a multiple change-point detection in the time series. In particular, we refer to the multi-scale formulation described in Fryzlewicz (Ann Stat 46(6B): 3390–3421, 2018). In that paper a bottom-up hierarchical structure is defined. At each stage, multiple neighbor regions which are recognized to correspond to locally constant underlying signal are merged. Due to their multi-scale structure, wavelets are suitable as basis functions, since the coefficients of the representation contain local information. The preprocessing stage involves the discrete unbalanced Haar transform, which is a wavelet decomposition of one-dimensional data with respect to an orthonormal Haar-like basis, where jumps in the basis vectors do not necessarily occur in the middle of their support.

The algorithm is tested on data from a well-characterized laboratory system described in Rouet-Leduc et al. (Geophys Res Lett 44(18): 9276–9282, 2017).},

	abstract = {Requirements Engineering (RE) is a key discipline for the success of software projects. Consistency, completeness, and accuracy are the requirements quality properties to be guaranteed by the verification task in RE. An overview of the actual trends in RE is briefly summarized, focusing more closely on the requirements verification quality properties. Completeness results is the most difficult property to guarantee. It is hard to capture the software behavior against the whole external context. In the last years, research has focused its attention to the application of semantic Web techniques to the different tasks of RE. The adoption of ontologies seems promising to achieve the proper level of formalism and to argue on quality properties. This paper presents a survey of the main concepts that need to be accounted for requirement verification, and proposes an ontological engineering approach to demonstrate the overlapping of requirements against the external context.},

	year = {2021},
	journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT},
	volume = {58},
	abstract = {The platforms supporting the smart city applications are rarely implemented from scratch by a municipality and/or totally owned by a single company, but are more typically realized by integrating some existing ICT infrastructures thanks to a supporting platform, such as the well known FIWARE platform. Such a multi-tenant deployment model is required to lower the initial investment costs to implement large scale solutions for smart cities, but also imposes some key security obstacles. In fact, smart cities support critical applications demanding to protect the data and functionalities from malicious and unauthorized uses. Equipping the supporting platforms with proper means for access control is demanding, but these means are typically implemented according to a centralized approach, where a single server stores and makes available a set of identity attributes and authorization policies. Having a single root of trust is not suitable in a distributed and cooperating scenario of large scale smart cities due to their multi-tenant deployment. In fact, each of the integrated system has its own set of security policies, and the other systems need to be aware of these policy, in order to allow a seamless use of the same credentials across the overall infrastructure (realizing what is known as the single-sign-on). This imposes the problem of consistent and secure data replicas within a distributed system, which can be properly approached by using the blockchain technology. Therefore, this work proposes a novel solution for distributed management of identity and authorization policies by leveraging on the blockchain technology to hold a global view of the security policies within the system, and integrating it in the FIWARE platform. A detailed assessment is provided to evaluate the goodness of the proposed approach and to compare it with the existing solutions.},

	abstract = {Today the main limit to Cloud adoption is related to the perception of a security loss the users have. Indeed, the existing solutions to provide security are mainly focused on Cloud Provider prospective in order to securely integrate frameworks and Infrastructures as a Services (IaaS) in a Cloud datacenter. There is no way to monitor and evaluate the provided security. In fact, Service Level Agreements mainly focus on performance related terms and no guarantees are given for security mechanisms. Users are interested in tools to verify and monitor the implemented security requirements. On the other side, developers need tools to deploy Cloud application offering measurable security grants to end users. In this paper we will propose an approach to implement security mechanisms as components in the application design process. We modeled security interactions according to the specific threat, the specific security requirements and user/application capabilities trying to improve security and enable a Service Provider to offer security guarantees to customers. The approach has been designed to fit with different Cloud platforms, but to demonstrate its applicability, we will present a case study on the mOSAIC Platform.},

However, the SMS is not natively designed to exchange medium/large-sized amount of data and it has been shown that such facility is highly unreliable, especially when some particular conditions occur. In this work, we propose an efficient protocol which allows to emulate a reliable data channel on data less devices, by using the SMS as underlying communication facility. Such protocol overcomes the issues arising from the structure and the functioning of that facility, when it has to send/receive significant amount of data. The approach we propose enables to transfer a variable-sized amount of data through SMS messages, with the main aim of ensuring the reliability of communication as well as of minimizing other factors, such as the number of SMS messages sent and the energy required to perform such tasks. These characteristics make the protocol we propose suitable for data communication when the only network coverage available is the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and consequently, the SMS is the only facility to exploit. In addition, we address both the constraints arising from the limited energy budget of mobile devices and the security issues emerging in this context.},

	abstract = {The term Internet of Things (IoT) is used as an umbrella that covers several topics, re- lated to the application of technological means to monitor, measure and act upon the en- vironment. As a result, it is difficult to determine a univocal architecture to identify as a reference and several scenarios, involving different sensors, smart devices, networks or gateways, can unfold. The data exchanged within and among IoT frameworks are growing exponentially, and the pervasiveness of such systems brings them to come in possession of very sensitive information: as a consequence, Security and Privacy have become a hot topic on the IoT scenery. Furthermore, due to the great variety of technological solutions which are currently available, interoperability issues are bound to arise, especially when no standard API interface, or communication protocol, has been officially adopted. This paper provides a review of the most common architectural solutions available to- day to shape an IoT system, ranging from already standardized architecture to commercial ones. Elements from such architectures have been compared, analysed and mapped one against the other to determine a stable reference for Security and Interoperability analysis. Current solutions in the Security and API Interoperability domains for IoT have been also analysed.},

	volume = {476},
	abstract = {The incremented popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to improvements both in hardware and software of sensors over the last years, enables the possibility to monitor and gather any kind of data. Additionally, the arrangement of heterogeneous sensors, capable of perceiving information about their surroundings, into a rich Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) allows the appearance of complex systems in which resources are managed more efficiently. Smart cities, buildings, parkings, emergency services are appearing, where control over energy consumption and better sustainability are coupled with an improvement of the comfort of occupants. In this paper, we address the problem of energy optimization in smart buildings, considering both the planning and operational aspects. Specifically, the first aim is to propose an optimal deployment of the WSN inside a building. For this, we present a model able to identify the optimal locations for different types of sensors and gateways, by optimizing energy consumption while fulfilling connectivity, resource, protection, and clustering coverage constraints. Once the IoT system is deployed, we address the problem of how the building actually functions, according to the behaviour of the occupants. In particular, we propose a Building Management System (BMS) capable of efficiently and automatically manage the building elements using human behavioural models, thus lowering the overall building energy consumption whilst maintaining acceptable levels of comfort.},

	journal = {SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE},
	volume = {39},
	abstract = {Location-aware computing is a form of context-aware mobile computing, that refers to
the ability of providing users with services that depend on their position. Locating the
user terminal, often said positioning, is essential in this form of computing. To this aim,
several technologies exist, ranging from personal area networking, to indoor, outdoor and
up to geographic area systems. Developers of location-aware software applications have
to face with a number of design choices, that typically depend on the chosen technology.
This work addresses the problem of easing the development of pull location-aware
applications, by allowing uniform access to multiple heterogeneous positioning systems.
To this aim, the paper proposes an approach to structure location-aware mobile
computing systems in a way independent of positioning technologies. The approach
consists in structuring the system into a layered architecture, that provides application
developers with a standard Java Application Programming Interface (JSR-179 API), and
encapsulates location data management and technology-specic positioning subsystems
into lower layers with clear interfaces. In order to demonstrate the proposed approach
we present the development of HyLocSys. It is an open hybrid software architecture
designed to support indoor/outdoor applications, that allows the uniform (combined or
separate) use of several positioning technologies. HyLocSys uses a hybrid data model,
which allows the integration of symbolic and geometric coordinates. It allows to support
handset- and infrastructure- based positioning approaches respecting the privacy of user.
The paper presents a prototypal implementation of HyLocSys for heterogeneous
scenarios. It has been implemented and tested on several platforms and mobile devices.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing represents both a technology for using distributed computing infrastructures in a more efficient way, and a business model for renting computing services and resources. It is an opportunity for customers to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Moreover, it gives to small and medium enterprises the possibility of using services and technologies that were prerogative of large ones, by paying only for the used resources and avoiding unnecessary investment. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use resources and services on the base of a pay-by-use model, implies an incredible flexibility in terms of management, which is otherwise often hard to address. In this paper, we propose an approach to to build up SLA-oriented Cloud applications, which enable a Cloud provider to offer service customized on the customer security needing. In particular, by using a Cloud-oriented API derived from the mOSAIC project, the developer can implement security features that can be offered by the Cloud provider within their Service Level Agreement. In particular, we focus on providing an intrusion tolerance service to grant an application service availability even when the host system is under attack.},

	abstract = {"The cloud paradigm, based on the idea of delegating to the network any kind of computational resources, is showing a considerable success. The estimated trend is that the number of different cloud-based solutions, approaches, and service providers (CSP) will continue growing. Despite the big number of different cloud solutions that currently exist, most of them are “walled gardens” unable to interoperate. On the other side, a large effort is taking place in the cloud community to develop and identify open solutions and standards. In such a context the concept of cloud federation, an architecture that combines the functionalities of different CSP, is a hot topic. This chapter presents an overview of the cloud federation topic, with special focus on its most important security challenges. Furthermore, it proposes a taxonomy of possible approaches to federation. Then it proposes a comparison of security problems in cloud and grid environment, and a detailed analysis of two relevant security problems, identity management and Cyber Attacks analysis, trying to outline how they can be applied in a federated context."},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Abstract: In order to overcome the provisioning and scalability limits of a single cloud, cloud federation appears as the computing model in which multiple resources from independent cloud providers can be shared to create large-scale distributed virtual clusters. On the other hand, these complex architectures become an attractive target for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Although, federated cloud environments have large amount of resources and profound dynamic allocation capability, which can be used to face DDoS attacks, they are however vulnerable to attacks that aim at compromising the service level agreements. In this paper, we investigate the key research topics for supporting distributed intrusion detection in a federated cloud environment. We propose a scalable intrusion detection solution, which can be used by cloud providers to protect the federated cloud infrastructure, as well as offered to the cloud service providers to monitor the hosted applications. We present a multi-layer architecture, which exploits a publish/subscribe middleware to collect and share security information in the federated cloud infrastructure. Moreover, we present an open-source framework, which provides features and interfaces to develop and deploy security components, as well as to define customised event correlation rules used to detect possible inter-cloud attacks.},

A relevant and fair comparison is still challenging due to diverse deployment options and dissimilar features of different services. This paper addresses a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model involving the selection of cloud services among the available alternatives. The proposed methodology assigns various ranks to cloud services based on the quantified quality-of-service parameters using a novel extended Grey Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution integrated with analytical hierarchical process. Further, we analyse the proposed cloud service selection method in terms of sensitivity analysis, adequacy under change in alternatives, adequacy to support group decision-making, and handling of uncertainty. This analysis helps both researchers and practitioners for analysing more fruitful approaches for cloud service selection.},

	year = {2015},
	journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS},
	volume = {Febbraio 2015},
	abstract = {Several studies show that the lack of access to resources and shared data is one of the main causes of errors in the healthcare sector. In particular, 3D medical images play a fundamental role in healthcare environment, but they are typically very large in size. Therefore, their management, which should be performed also by means of devices with limited characteristics, requires complex network protocols along with advanced compression and security techniques. This work concerns the secure management of 3D medical images, with the main aim that such management must take place in an almost completely transparent manner for the user, regardless of the computational and networking capabilities he may use. In particular, our contribution is twofold: first, we propose an engine for lossless dynamic and adaptive compression of 3D medical images, which also allows the embedding of security watermarks within them. Furthermore, in order to provide effective, secure and flexible access to healthcare resources that need to be managed by medical applications, we define the architecture of a SaaS Cloud system, which is based on the aforementioned engine. The resulting architecture allows devices with totally different and heterogeneous hardware and software characteristics to interact among them, so that these differences are almost completely transparent to the end user.},

	booktitle = {IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing},
	abstract = {Location estimation based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) is the prevalent method in indoor positioning. For RSS-based methods a massive collection of training RSS samples is needed to calibrate the positioning system and to achieve a high positioning quality. The quality of these methods is directly related to the placement of the wireless sensors in the workspace and the Radio Map used to compute the user location. Traditionally deploying the reference points and building the Radio Map require human intervention and are extremely time-consuming. In this paper we aim to reduce these manual calibration efforts. We propose an automatic approach both to build a Radio Map in the given environment and to assess the best system calibration that fits the required positioning quality. The approach has been tested on the most used radio frequency-based technologies, i.e., IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth},

This work proposes a novel architecture to mitigate the diversity of service representations, technologies, and interaction models of current service discovery platforms. The ultimate goal is to allow nomadic users to discover services across domain borders. The proposed architecture is composed of discovery agents that connect domains into a single logical domain, and allow services to be imported and exported between heterogeneous domains.},

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems are the major technology used for protecting information systems. However, they do not directly detect intrusion, but they only monitor the attack symptoms. Therefore, no assumption can be made on the outcome of the attack, no assurance can be assumed once the system is compromised. The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed approach results in a better performance of the Intrusion Detection Systems, in terms of increasing diagnosis capacity as well as reducing the service unavailability during an intrusion.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing paradigm represents an opportunity for users to reduce costs and increase the eciency, providing an alternative way of using services and computational resources. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way, as well as a business model for selling computing resources. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use services and resources on the base of an on-demand, self-service, and pay-by-use business model, implies incredible exibility in terms of management, which is otherwise hard to address. On the other hand, because of this exibility, cyber attacks represent a serious danger, which can compromise performance and availability of the services provided to Cloud consumers. In this paper, we propose an open-source framework for designing distributed Intrusion Detection System for multiple Cloud vendor infrastructures. The proposed framework provides Application Programming Interface and tools to develop multiple probes, which can be dynamically deployed as a distributed architecture. It enables to collect security information at dierent Cloud architectural levels, which can be used to perform event correlation and diagnosis analysis of intrusion in the Cloud-based systems.},

In this scenario, the location systems should be able of tracking the mobile users in any place they move to, both indoor and outdoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid location approach designed to support the choice and the switching between different positioning technologies supported by the mobile device and available in the surrounding environment, in a dynamic and transparent way during the user movement. It combines signal strength-based fingerprinting techniques for indoor positioning together with GPS for the outdoor localization, and performs opportunistic technology switching according to a threshold based mechanism. The resulting solution is able to leverage the different features of the location technologies, in order to provide ubiquitous services across indoor and outdoor scenarios, as well as to minimize power consumption of the mobile device.},

	year = {2020},
	journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT},
	volume = {57},
	abstract = {Due to the large scale of the typical deployments and the involvement of moving objects to the Internet of Things, participating nodes opportunistically establish data exchanging connections, spanning across multiple organizations and security domains. This opportunistic behavior causes the impossibility of defining valid security policies to rule node authorization, and the ineffectiveness of traditional static access control models based on roles or attributes. Trust management is a promising solution to complement these conventional rules and models by realizing a more dynamic security approach and regulating connection request acceptance or rejection based on monitored behaviors. As a centralized authority cannot be established within multi-tenant and large scale infrastructures, decentralized approaches have recently emerged, supported by the blockchain technology, and applied to the case of useful Internet of Things implementations. However, they are vulnerable to possible attacks aiming at discrediting honest nodes (by lowering their trust degree) and/or redeem malicious nodes (by increasing their trust degree). The widely-accepted protection consists of securing the communications by using SSL/TLS, and restricting the nodes allowed to update the trust degree. However, they are known to be ineffective against compromised nodes that, despite holding legitimate security claims and cryptographic material, they deviate from the correct behavior by sending false and mendacious scores. This work proposes to exploit on game theory to realize robust decentralized trust management able to tolerate malicious nodes sending mendacious scores. Explicitly, a signaling node has been formalized to model the interactions between the IoT and the edge nodes by refusing potentially untrue scores. Moreover, the evolutionary Dempster-Shafer theory is used to combine the collected scores to update nodes’ trust degrees, by excluding diverging scores far from the majority. Such solutions have been implemented within the context of a blockchain-supported trust management solution for IoT, and an empirical assessment is provided to show the quality of the proposed approach.},

	year = {2023},
	journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS},
	volume = {212},
	abstract = {The controller placement problem (CPP) is one of the main issues that need to be addressed in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), especially when different aspects are being considered, such as latency, capacity, reliability, and load balancing. Most of the solutions in the literature address these aspects by considering a fixed load for each controller and attempting to equally distribute the traffic demand of the switches among the controllers, which also have a fixed common capacity. On the contrary, in this work, the CPP is studied by considering load, controller capacity, and the failure probability of controllers and links as varying over time. The CPP is formulated in terms of a robust optimization problem, which, by introducing the concept of scenario, takes into account changes in the network status due to failures, load variations, and changes in switches’ demand and controllers’ capacity. The provided solution is robust, that is, neither controllers’ re-placement nor switches’ re-assignment is required as network conditions change. Besides, a co-evolutionary algorithm is provided to solve the aforementioned optimization problem. Two populations coevolve based on the concept of complementary evolution of allied species in nature. Experimental results on a set of real-world network topologies and comparisons with the state-of-the-art have proven the superiority of the proposal, in terms of better latency, load balancing and resilience, in solving the CPP under different network status changes that might occur over time.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Recently, the positioning techniques based on the IEEE 802.11 signal strength are becoming the dominant solutions in the mobile device localization within indoor scenarios. Such solutions are characterized by two main pitfalls that compromise their effective usage in real application environments. First, during the calibration, a large amount of manual effort is required for acquiring a massive collection of training samples. Second, the positioning accuracy is directly related to the deployment of the wireless access points into the workspace, which is extremely time-consuming and requires human intervention. This paper presents an approach to reduce the manual calibration and to optimize the positioning accuracy, by selecting the best deployment schema of the wireless access points. The approach has been implemented in a tool, which uses an analytical signal propagation model to build the radio map of a given workspace, and exploits a multi-objective genetic algorithm to identify the best access points placement pattern that fits the required accuracy. A detailed experimental campaign is presented in order to show the benefits achievable by the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Today the main limit to Cloud adoption is related to the perception of a security loss the users have. Indeed, the existing solutions to provide security are mainly focused on Cloud service provider prospective in order to securely integrate frameworks and Infrastructures as a Services in a Cloud datacenter. Customer could not monitor and evaluate the security mechanisms enforced by service provider. Service Level Agreements mainly focus on performance related terms and no guarantees are given for security mechanisms. Customers are interested in tools to verify and monitor the implemented security requirements. On the other hand, developers need tools to deploy Cloud applications offering measurable security grants to end users. In this paper, we propose an approach to implement security mechanisms as components in the application design process. We modeled security interactions according to the specific threat, the specific security requirements and user/application capabilities trying to improve security. It enables a Service Provider to offer security guarantees to customers. The approach has been designed to fit with different Cloud platforms, but to demonstrate its applicability, we will present a case study on the mOSAIC Platform.},

We propose a rule-based solution, which is implemented as a decentralized solution, which delegates the verification of rules to independent mobile agents. Agents are software components that interact with neighboring objects and react on the basis of the surrounding context. Moreover, a simulation tool is presented. It is used to model the remote scenario by collecting of context information from the field. It supports the on-line monitoring of the ongoing activities and the prediction of future situations.

	abstract = {Consistency within the system life cycle is difficult to guarantee, due to the cross of different skills and requirements, often expressed by means of different languages. In particular, in safety-critical systems consistency between software requirements and safety analysis requires checks to guarantee that safety engineer needs are feasible and implemented by the system. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic technique to analyze the failure modes of components, evaluating their impact and their mitigation actions, which are procedures to be implemented by operators or by the system itself (usually by the software). Although the actual efforts to centralize system information in a structured way, safety analysis is not tied in a structured manner to other systems, in particular to software. This paper proposes an automatic approach to check consistency between FMEA and software requirements with a bit effort of formalization. The approach models FMEA and software requirements with Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets and checks their consistency on the basis of consistency rules.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {The interworking between cellular and wireless local area networks, as well as the spreading of mobile devices equipped with several positioning technologies pave the ground to new and more favorable indoor/outdoor location-based services (LBSs). Thus, wireless internet service providers are required to take several positioning methods into account at the same time, to leverage the different features of existing technologies. This would allow providing LBSs satisfying the user-required quality of position in terms of accuracy, privacy, power consumption, and often, conflicting features. Therefore, this paper presents GlobalPreLoc, a multi-objective strategy for the dynamic and optimal selection of positioning technologies. The strategy exploits a pattern-mining algorithm for future position prediction combined with conventional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, for choosing continuously the best location providers, accounting for the user requirements, the terminal capabilities, and the surrounding positioning infrastructures. To practically implement the strategy, we also designed an architecture based on secure user plane location specification to provide indoor and outdoor LBSs in interworking wireless networks exploiting GlobalPreLoc features.},

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {The success of the Cloud Computing paradigm is due to its on-demand, self-service, and pay-by-use nature. According to this paradigm, the effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks involve not only the quality of the delivered service, but also the service maintenance costs in terms of resource consumption. Specifically, the longer the detection delay is, the higher the costs to be incurred. Therefore, a particular attention has to be paid for stealthy DoS attacks. They aim at minimizing their visibility, and at the same time, they can be as harmful as the brute-force attacks. They are sophisticated attacks tailored to leverage the worst-case performance of the target system through specific periodic, pulsing, and low-rate traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose a strategy to orchestrate stealthy attack patterns, which exhibit a slowly-increasing-intensity trend designed to inflict the maximum financial cost to the cloud customer, while respecting the job size and the service arrival rate imposed by the detection mechanisms. We describe both how to apply the proposed strategy, and its effects on the target system deployed in the cloud.},

In particular, the cloud elasticity allows customers to scale-up their applications in order to provide services to a larger number of end-users.

According to such a model, Distributed Denial of Service attacks can be transformed in a new breed of attacks, which target the cloud flexibility, in order to inflict fraudulent resource consumptions. In this paper, we proposed an approach to mitigate such new kind of threats in Cloud Computing, which have direct effects on the customer costs and not only on the service performance perceived by end-users.},

	year = {2023},
	journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS},
	abstract = {The continuous emergence of new and sophisticated malware specifically targeting Android-based Internet of Things devices is causing significant security hazards and is consequently fostering the need for effective detection models and strategies able to work with these hardware-constrained devices. In addition, since such models are often trained on confidential application data, many involved subjects are reluctant to share their data for this purpose. Accordingly, several Federated Learning-based solutions are emerging, which rely on the capabilities of Machine Learning models in malware detection/classification without sharing user data. However, Federated Learning methods are often adversely affected by non-independent and identically distributed data in terms of both the required training time and classification results. Therefore, a promising solution could be to overcome the Federated Learning-related issues by preserving the privacy of end-user data. In this direction, the capabilities of Markov chains and associative rules are extended within a federated environment to face malware classification tasks in the IoT scenario. The presented approach, evaluated on several malware families, has achieved an average accuracy of 99% in the presence of centralized and decentralized unbalanced training/testing data by overcoming the most common state-of-the-art approaches. Also, its runtime performance is comparable with centralized ones by considering several non independent and identically distributed dataset partitions, splitting criteria, and clients, respectively.},

In order to analyze some specific processes of an ophthalmology ward of a large Italian hospital, ProM6 framework was implemented, which supports process mining techniques in form of plug-ins; the plug-ins process data, in form of Event Log, in order to extract information about the process. The DES model based on such information was run via a commercial tool, Simul8, which allows building sophisticated process models. A timely algorithm was then deployed to adapt the ProM6 information to the DES model. Following, a conformance analysis was conducted by comparing the original Event Log, and the Simulation tool data, taking into account the main case-related model attributes (routing probabilities profile, time perspective, and resources perspective). The paper aims at developing the line of inquiry for what concerns the deployment of approaches to set forth the link between Process mining and Simulation modeling.},

We developed a flexible software tool that gathers data from organizations in an automatic way – through adapted connectors – and generates abundant results on the measurement and distribution of employees’ performances. The main challenges of human resource departments – quantification of human resource performance, analysis of the distribution of performance, and early identification of employees willing to leave the workforce – are handled through the proposed IT platform. Insights are presented on different granularity levels, from organization view down to department, group, and team.},

	abstract = {Location estimation based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) is the prevalent method in indoor positioning. For such positioning systems, a massive collection of training samples is needed for their calibration. The accuracy of these methods is directly related to the placement of the reference points and the radio map used to compute the device location. Traditionally, deploying the reference points and building the radio map require human intervention and are extremely time-consuming. In this paper we present an approach to reduce the manual calibration efforts needed to deploy an RSS-based localization system, both when using only one RF technology or when using a combination of RF technologies. It is an automatic approach both to build a radio map in a given workspace by means of a signal propagation model, and to assess the system calibration that best fits the required accuracy by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm.},

	year = {2009},
	booktitle = {IEEE Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing},
	abstract = {Web applications are vulnerable to a variety of new security threats. SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the most significant of such threats. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.},

	year = {2011},
	journal = {ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
	abstract = {Software development teams that use agile methodologies are increasingly adopting the test-driven development practice (TDD). TDD allows to produce software by iterative and incremental work cycle, and with a strict control over the process, favouring an early detection of bugs. However, when applied to large and complex systems, TDD benets are not so obvious: manually locating and xing bugs introduced during the iterative development steps is a non-trivial task. In such systems, the propagation chains following the bugs activation can be unacceptably long and intricate, and the size of the code to be analyzed is often too large. In this paper, a bug localization technique specically tailored to TDD is presented. The technique is embedded in the TDD cycle and it aims to improve developers' ability to locate bugs as soon as possible. It is implemented in a tool, and experimentally evaluated on newly developed Java programs.},

	year = {2005},
	booktitle = {25th IEEE International Conference onDistributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2005.},
	abstract = {Designing and developing location-aware portable software applications is challenging, since most location-estimation methods i) require non-standard features either in the mobile terminal or in the network infrastructure, and ii) they are specifically designed for either indoor or outdoor. Moreover, installing and tuning systems that rely on such location methods may be quite a complex operation. In this paper we propose a software architecture that makes a combined use of indoor and outdoor location-sensing technologies. On top of the architecture there is a generic API, aimed at supporting the development of hybrid (indoor/outdoor) applications at a high level of abstraction, independent of the location technology. The API is meant to support applications for which the exact position of a mobile terminal is not a primary requirement, but it suffices to identify the terminal position in a known set of zones (e.g., rooms indoor, or pre-defined outdoor areas). The software architecture is designed: i) to ensure compliance with emerging positioning standards and commercial devices, in order to leverage the interoperability with third-party developed services, and ii) to be based on low-cost and easily deployable and tunable indoor positioning infrastructures. An implementation of the architecture is described, based on Bluetooth and GPS technologies, so as to outline the major implementation issues},

On-board diagnostic systems are able to provide a huge amount of information about the state of the vehicle during the flight, by monitoring sensors, software, and hardware components. However, the ability of processing such data in an online manner is a serious obstacle to a timely detection and diagnosis of failures. This paper proposes a method to progressively focus the data collection on signals providing the most reliable information about the system failure probability, so as to reduce considerably the number of false alarms and/or undetected failures, and to ease the online data processing. We set a simulation experiment showing that the proposed approach is able to select the most informative subset of signals in few iterations in an effective and efficient way.},

In this work, we aim at extending the positioning service in order to detect and localize different kinds of objects of the everyday life, exploiting cheap and embedded technologies.

	abstract = {The Cloud Computing paradigm has been an incredible success in the last few years. It is based on the idea of delegate to the Cloud provider every kind of resources, and let the users access them in a self-service fashion. The Cloud paradigm has largely been adopted in several different contexts and applied to an incredibly large set of technologies. It is an opportunity for IT users to reduce costs and increase efficiency providing an alternative way of using IT services. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way and a business model for selling computing resources. It gives to small and medium enterprises the possibility of using services and technologies that were prerogative of large ones, by paying only for the resources needed and avoiding upfront investment. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use resources and services on the base of a pay-per-use model, implies incredible flexibility in terms of management, which is otherwise often hard to address. On the other hand, because of this flexibility new problems emerge, which involve the evaluation and monitoring of the quality of the acquired resources and services as well as threats that can compromise performance and availability of services provided to final users. This chapter describes some open challenges to performance evaluation and provisioning in Cloud, and presents a survey on the solutions and technologies proposed by research and open community to face such issues.},

	abstract = {In this work a distributed video surveillance system based on a Client-Server architecture is presented. The proposed system is accessible from portable devices such as tablets, smartphones, etc. In a typical real-world scenario, for example in homeland security, it is useful to have portable devices that can receive in real-time a frame or a sequence of frames coming from a selected camera to prevent or to detect attacks (i.e. terrorist attacks, etc.). In the proposed system, a portable device knows only the address of the server (repository), and the repository sends to the portable device the list of the clients (nodes) which are connected with one or more cameras. When the portable device obtains the list of the nodes, it connects directly to a specific node and requests the images of its connected cameras. The whole system provides secure communication channel between all its components. The security of both the node-repository and the repository-portable devices communications is guaranteed by using a secure connection. The security of the node-portable devices interconnection is provided by a digital invisible watermarking algorithm that affects each image before sending it from the node to the portable devices. Each portable device can extract the watermark and verify the identity of the node.},

Therefore, federating multiple clouds is enjoying a lot of attention from the academic and commercial point of views. In this context, publish-subscribe is a widely used paradigm to support the interoperability of federated clouds. In this paper, we describe some potential vulnerabilities of a publish-subscribe based federated cloud system. In particular, we propose an agentbased system that aims at monitoring security vulnerabilities that affect such kind of inter-cloud cooperation solutions.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a system for distributed video surveillance based on the Client-Server model. The system we present can be accessed via portable devices. In many real-world scenarios is useful, or sometimes necessary, to have portable devices that can receive real-time data from a selected camera, to prevent or to manage anomalous activities. The system provides reliable, high speed, secure and real-time communication among all its components, which are the Repository, the Node and the Portable Device. Both Repository and Node can act as a server. The Repository can provide services to both Nodes and Portable Devices, while the Nodes provide services only to the Portable Device. The portable device can only act as a client, using the services offered by the other two parts. In our system, a portable device is assumed to know only the location of the Repository which permits to get the list of nodes connected with one or more camera(s). When a portable device gets the list, it can choose which node intends to connect to, to get the images of its connected camera(s). The security of the interaction among Node-Repository and Node-Portable Device is guaranteed by using the SSL/TLS protocol. The interaction among nodes and portable devices is secured by using an invisible digital watermarking algorithm on each image, before that image is sent from a node to a portable device. The latter extracts the watermark from the image and verifies the identity of the node.},

	abstract = {Position represents a relevant attribute needed by many applications, whose contexts are characterized by pervasiveness of the objects/things in the considered scenarios. In order to infer positions of pervasive objects, which are neither equipped with any location-sensing technologies, nor are unable to locate themselves, it is needed to support them with an appropriate infrastructure, which allows to determine their position in a manner that is transparent to applications. In this work, we aim at extending the positioning service using an agent-based approach, in order to discover and localize different kinds of objects, exploiting cheap and embedded technologies. We describe the design and the implementation of a layered architecture, that supports the localization of devices, and simple pervasive and ubiquitous objects. A simulation tool has been develop to evaluate the proposed solution in different application scenarios of every-day life. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Intrusion Tolerance is an emerging paradigm for developing systems, which continue to operate correctly, and provide acceptable services even in the face of an intrusion. The effectiveness of this approach is strongly dependent on the efficiency of the adopted detection and diagnosis mechanisms. In this work, we propose an architectural framework, which collects information at several architectural levels, using multiple security probes, which are deployed as a distributed architecture, to perform event correlation and diagnosis analysis of intrusion symptoms. The experimental results show that the use of different security information sources can improve the detection and the diagnosis of attacks},

	abstract = {Prediction of market prices is an important and well-researched problem. While traditional techniques have yielded good results, rooms for improvement still exists, especially in the ability to explain sudden changes in behavior, as a response to shocks. Nonlinear systems have been successfully used to describe phase transitions in deterministic chaotic systems, so the combination of the expressive power of nonlinear systems and the efficient computation of linear models is an attractive idea. On such basis, in this work, an hybrid model is proposed that tunes its regression parameters with the results of nonlinear tools.
Experiments, performed on several stocks in diverse sector and markets, show interesting performances, confirming as well the presence of distinct phases in the stock evolution, characterized by distinctly separated dynamics.},

	abstract = {Digital images play an important role in a wide range of medical applications. Several widespread technologies for digital imaging, such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR), etc., produce three-dimensional images. Data compression, is thus essential to reduce the volume of such images, permitting their efficient storing along with the improvement of the relative transmission time through Internet or any other ad-hoc systems, like Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), Tele-radiology, etc.. Since these images are often stored in system particularly vulnerable from the point of view of security, especially because they contain sensitive data, it is necessary to provide such images with a mechanism which ensures at least security against message forgery. In fact, an attack can be made by altering a medical image, and consequently, may alter the relative diagnosis. The purpose of this work is twofold, first we propose a low complexity approach for the compression of 3-D medical images, then, in order to limit the above defined potential attack, we proposed en efficient method to insert within each image an invisible digital watermark, during the compression process. In this way, we define a hybrid approach that handles simultaneously and efficiently both the compression that the security of three-dimensional images. We validate the proposed approach by showing test results.},

Semantic techniques and full text search are used to support human experts for the analysis and classification of test logs, in order to speedup and improve the diagnosis phase. Moreover, retrieval of tests and requirements, which can be related to the current failure, is supported in order to allow the discovery of available alternatives and solutions for a better and faster investigation of the problem.},

	abstract = {Location-Based Services (LBSs) will be one of the main sources of revenue for wireless network operators. Emergency services, information services, fleet-monitoring services, tracking the location of vehicles, objects and users are some of the most promising location applications. The current interworking between the third-generation systems and the wireless networks, along with the spreading of the new mobile devices equipped with multi location sensing technologies, pave the ground to new and more favourable services. Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) need to take into account several elements for ensuring valuable LBSs. The adopted location platforms should be able to leverage the different features of the wireless networks and of the existing positioning techniques in order to always provide ubiquitous LBSs with high accuracy across heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the adopted platform architecture and its protocols need to be carefully designed for providing highly scalable and interoperable services. For instance, the use of open standards can favourWISPs interoperability and hence multi-vendors LBSs integration. We first present the elements involved in high-quality LBSs provisioning. Then a possible two-tier open-standard based architecture for inferring and exchanging indoor and outdoor location information through heterogeneous wireless networks is presented. Privacy and security issues are also discussed.},

In this paper, we investigate the key research topics for supporting distributed intrusion detection in Cloud environments. Moreover, we present a distributed architecture for providing intrusion detection in Cloud Computing, which enables Cloud providers to offer security solutions as a service. It is a hierarchical and multi-layer architecture designed to collect information in the Cloud environment, using multiple distributed security components, which can be used to perform complex event correlation analysis.},

This transformed our lives in a way that it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to deal with day-by-day activities without being 'connected". The technology that enable an individual to take advantage, in the best way, of the Ubiquitous Computing paradigm is the Mobile Computing Communication that is fostered by the wide adoption of smart devices such as mobile phone, smartphones, tablets and so on. In this work we investigate the possibility of reliably sending a small file via Short Message Service (SMS) by using data compression for a more effective mobile data exchange in which basic GSM is the only available data communication option. We present an application for portable devices, called Smart Text Compression and Encryption for Short Message Service (STCESMS), based on Google Android OS that can compress and/or encrypt a file or generic message and send it via SMS, according to different strategies properly influenced by the containment of delivery cost or energy consumption objectives. STCESMS also provides encryption services, implemented by using the Data Encryption Standard, after the compression process.},

	abstract = {The distributed and complexity nature of modern critical infrastructures that have to provide integrated services through the interoperability of heterogeneous subsystems, even spread among different countries, require new methodologies and tools to dominate overall systems complexity. In particular, in order to get knowledge about their real behavior and define dependability improvement actions, such complex and distributed systems should be reproduced and simulated locally. On the other hand, the extraordinary large number of their components cause a large-scale of the resulting model, limiting its resolution by current simulators. This paper presents a framework to implement hybrid simulation of distributed large-scale critical infrastructures, such as Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Vessel Traffic System (VTS). High Level Architecture (HLA) has been introduced into the engine simulations platform as its design and development foundation, whereas cloud-based virtualization techniques have been exploited in order to reproduce the overall distributed system on a local adaptive testbed. The use of such a framework can result in a considerable reduction of costs in all the system life phases, as well as an increased system dependability level.},

	abstract = {The Java Community Process (JCP) has recently finalized a Java Specification Request (JSR) to cope with location-awareness (JSR-179) in Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC). Implementations of this specification may rely on several location methods, including satellite based methods like GPS, as well as short-range positioning methods based on Received Signal Strength (RSS). Though RSS is a good location fingerprint for indoor positioning, no standard technique to tailor RSS-based approaches to the JSR-179 API has been proposed yet. In this paper we propose such a technique, and we evaluate its effectiveness through a Bluetooth-based prototype. Specifically, we show how to extend the Java APIs for Bluetooth (JSR-82) in order to provide the Location API with RSS-based position-information. Moreover, we show how to adapt RSS-based approaches to Location-API's semantics. Our solution is based on the insertion of a specific component into the JSR-82 API. This is in charge of producing all the information needed to build Location objects as defined in the JSR-179. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach by examining preliminary experimental results obtained from the first system prototype.},

	abstract = {In case of a crisis event, it is the responsibility of public and government authorities to manage the response operations. Positioning is a crucial task when managing emergency, which aims at estimating the positions of the first responders that act on the crisis site. On the other hand, the radio-based positioning solutions require a process of site survey, in which radio signatures have to be collected and stored in a radio map for further comparison and matching. Site survey involves intensive manual effort and time, which is no feasible during the crisis event. This paper proposes an approach for rapid site survey of the considered area. A specific tool has been developed to draw the site topography and to define the radio map generated by the wireless sensors located in the considered area, by using an accurate signal attenuation model. Experiment results show that the proposed solution can achieve a position accuracy that can be considered acceptable in the context of the rescuers localization even without a site survey activity.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a new business model, which represents an opportunity for users, companies, and public organisations to reduce costs and increase efficiency, as well as an alternative way for providing services and resources. In this pay-by-use model, security plays a key role. Cyber attacks are a serious danger, which can compromise the quality of the service delivered to the customers, as well as the costs of the provided cloud resources and services. In this paper, a hybrid and hierarchical event correlation approach for intrusion detection in cloud computing is presented. It consists of detecting intrusion symptoms by collecting diverse information at several cloud architectural levels, using distributed security probes, as well as performing complex event analysis based on a complex event processing engine. The escalation process from intrusion symptoms to the identified cause and target of the intrusion is driven by a knowledge-base represented by an ontology. A prototype implementation of the proposed intrusion detection solution is also presented.},

	abstract = {Requirements Engineering (RE) is a key discipline for the success of software projects. Consistency, completeness, and accuracy are the requirements quality properties to be guaranteed by the verification task in RE. An overview of the actual trends in RE is briefly summarized, focusing more closely on the requirements verification quality properties. Completeness results is the most difficult property to guarantee. It is hard to capture the software behavior against the whole external context. In the last years, research has focused its attention to the application of semantic Web techniques to the different tasks of RE. The adoption of ontologies seems promising to achieve the proper level of formalism and to argue on quality properties. This paper presents a survey of the main concepts that need to be accounted for requirement verification, and proposes an ontological engineering approach to demonstrate the overlapping of requirements against the external context.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in the undergoing fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0. It is considered a tremendous boost to company digitalization; thus, considerable investments in blockchain are being made. However, there is no single blockchain technology, but various solutions exist, and they cannot interoperate with one each other. The ecosystem envisioned by the Industry 4.0 does not have centralized management or leading organization, so a single blockchain solution cannot be imposed. The various organizations hold their own blockchains, which must interoperate seamlessly. Despite some solutions for blockchain interoperability being proposed, the problem is still open. This paper aims to devise a secure solution for blockchain interoperability. The proposed approach consists of a relay scheme based on Trusted Execution Environment to provide higher security guarantees than the current literature. In particular, the proposed solution adopts an off-chain secure computation element invoked by a smart contract on a blockchain to securely communicate with its peered counterpart. A prototype has been implemented and used for the performance assessment, e.g., to measure the latency increase due to cross-blockchain interactions. The achieved and reported experimental results show that the proposed security solution introduces an additional latency that is entirely tolerable for transactions. At the same time, the usage of the Trusted Execution Environment imposes a negligible overhead.},

	journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {The corneal epithelium represents one of the main structures that undergo degenerative alterations due to antiglaucomatous therapy. Chronic glaucoma therapy containing benzalkonium chloride induces epithelial cellular changes and inflammatory infiltration that in turn causes ocular surface changes resulting in ocular discomfort. Also age-related changes can involve the tear film stability and the corneal epithelium surface with reduction of microvilli. The objective of this study is to gain insights about the changes in corneal epithelium in glaucomatous patients divided according to age, type and duration of therapy using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). This study evaluated a total of 81 eyes of 42 patients for whom corneal epithelium thickness (CET) was measured in different sectors of the cornea. Our results showed no significant differences in CET among patients divided according to type and duration of treatment, while younger patients showed a thinner CET in comparison with older patients. AS-OCT results demonstrated that the physiological age-related alterations contributed to corneal epithelium changes in patients undergo chronic antiglaucoma therapy.

	year = {2021},
	journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
	volume = {184},
	abstract = {Nowadays, the proper management of data is a key business enabler and booster for companies, so as to increase their competitiveness. Typically, companies hold massive amounts of data within their servers, which might include previously offered services, proposals, bids, and so on. They rely on their expert managers to manually analyse them in order to make strategic decisions. However, given the huge amount of information to be analysed and the necessity of making timely decisions, they often exploit a small amount of the available data, which often does not yield effective choices. For instance, this happens in the context of the e-procurement domain, where bids for new calls for tender are often formulated by looking at some past proposals from a company. Driven by an extensive experience on the e-procurement domain, in this paper we propose an intelligent system to support organisations in the focused crawling of artefacts (calls for tender, BIMs, equipment, policies, market trends, and so on) of interest from the web, semantically matching them against internal Big Data and knowledge sources, so as to let companies analysts make better strategic decisions. The novel contribution consists of a proper extension of the K-means algorithm used by a web crawler within the proposed system, and a semantic module exploiting search patterns to find relevant data within the crawled artefacts. The proposed solution has been implemented and extensively assessed in the e-procurement domain. It has been successively extended to other domains, such as robot programming, cloud providing, and several other domains. Since to the best of our knowledge in the literature do not exists similar systems, in order to prove its effectiveness we have compared its crawling component against similar crawlers, by plugging them within our system.},

	abstract = {""This paper focuses on one of the most harmful categories of Denial of Service attacks, commonly known in the literature as “stealth” attacks. They are performed avoiding to send significant volumes of data, by injecting into the network a low-rate flow of packets in order to evade rate-controlling  detection mechanisms. This work presents an intrusion tolerance solution, which aims at providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised by such attacks. It describes all protection phases, from monitoring to diagnosis and recovery. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed approach results in a better performance of Intrusion Prevention Systems, in terms of reducing service unavailability during stealth attacks.""},

	abstract = {The convergence of wireless networking, mobile computing, pervasive devices, and location-sensing technologies has created a new class of computing, namely location-aware computing, that is based on the capability of an information infrastructure and/or of mobile terminals to recognize and to react to the user/object location. Standard protocols which allow an integrated use of heterogeneous technologies have been defined, but it is necessary to use terminals, which are enabled to exploit a minimal amount of resources and are equipped with required interfaces for localization and communication. In this work, we proposed a mobile agent-based solution that allows to detect and localize different kinds of objects of the everyday life, which are neither enabled to access the positioning infrastructure, nor support any location-sensing technologies. We describe the design and the prototypal implementation of a layered architecture, that supports the localization of devices, and simple pervasive and ubiquitous objects, by exploiting cheap and embedded technologies.},

	journal = {SOFT COMPUTING},
	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic. Stringent measures have been adopted to face the pandemic, such as complete lockdown, shutting down businesses and trade, as well as travel restrictions. Nevertheless, such solutions have had a tremendous economic impact. Although the use of recent vaccines seems to reduce the scale of the problem, the pandemic does not appear to finish soon. Therefore, having a forecasting model about the COVID-19 spread is of paramount importance to plan interventions and, then, to limit the economic and social damage. In this paper, we use Genetic Programming to evidence dependences of the SARS-CoV-2 spread from past data in a given Country. Namely, we analyze real data of the Campania Region, in Italy. The resulting models prove their effectiveness in forecasting the number of new positives 10/15&nbsp;days before, with quite a high accuracy. The developed models have been integrated into the context of SVIMAC-19, an analytical-forecasting system for the containment, contrast, and monitoring of Covid-19 within the Campania Region.},

	abstract = {The Cloud paradigm has largely been adopted in several different contexts and applied to an incredibly large set of technologies. It is an opportunity for IT users to reduce costs and increase efficiency providing an alternative way of using IT services. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way and a business model for selling computing resources. It gives to small and medium enterprises the possibility of using services and technologies that were prerogative of large ones, by paying only for the resources needed and avoiding upfront investment. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use resources and services on the base of a pay-per-use model, implies incredible flexibility in terms of management, which is otherwise often hard to address. On the other hand, because of this flexibility new problems emerge, which involve the evaluation and monitoring of the quality of the acquired resources and services. This chapter presents a survey on the solutions and technologies proposed by research and open community to face such issues.},
