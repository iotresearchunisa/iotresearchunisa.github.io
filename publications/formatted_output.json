On-board diagnostic systems are able to provide a huge amount of information about the state of the vehicle during the flight, by monitoring sensors, software, and hardware components. However, the ability of processing such data in an online manner is a serious obstacle to a timely detection and diagnosis of failures. This paper proposes a method to progressively focus the data collection on signals providing the most reliable information about the system failure probability, so as to reduce considerably the number of false alarms and/or undetected failures, and to ease the online data processing. We set a simulation experiment showing that the proposed approach is able to select the most informative subset of signals in few iterations in an effective and efficient way.","booktitle":"Proceedings - 2015 10th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing, 3PGCIC 2015","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","year":"2016","title":"Sampling UAV Most Informative Diagnostic Signals","author":"Pietrantuono, Roberto and Ficco, Massimo and Russo, Stefano and Gigante, Gabriella","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4776170"},{"pages":"360--367","isbn":"978-1-5090-4065-0","doi":"10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2016.77","booktitle":"2016 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 14th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 2nd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)","publisher":"IEEE","year":"2016","title":"Distributed Strategic Learning for Building Network Embedded Coding to Achieve Reliable Event Notification","author":"Esposito, Christiancarmine and Castiglione, Aniello and Palmieri, Francesco and Pop, Florin","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4674410"},{"pages":"103--108","isbn":"9781509018574","doi":"10.1109/WAINA.2016.39","keywords":"Brokering; Cloud federation; Critical applications; Smart grid; Computer Networks and Communications; Computer Science Applications1707 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Information Systems; Information Systems and Management; Modeling and Simulation","abstract":"Abstract\u2014Cloud computing is probably the simplest and best fitted way for improving scalability and flexibility of a smart-grid, however, migrating such critical data-intensive applications to the cloud is not a trivial challenge.

Therefore, federating multiple clouds is enjoying a lot of attention from the academic and commercial point of views. In this context, publish-subscribe is a widely used paradigm to support the interoperability of federated clouds. In this paper, we describe some potential vulnerabilities of a publish-subscribe based federated cloud system. In particular, we propose an agentbased system that aims at monitoring security vulnerabilities that affect such kind of inter-cloud cooperation solutions.","booktitle":"Int.

However, the SMS is not natively designed to exchange medium/large-sized amount of data and it has been shown that such facility is highly unreliable, especially when some particular conditions occur. In this work, we propose an efficient protocol which allows to emulate a reliable data channel on data less devices, by using the SMS as underlying communication facility. Such protocol overcomes the issues arising from the structure and the functioning of that facility, when it has to send/receive significant amount of data. The approach we propose enables to transfer a variable-sized amount of data through SMS messages, with the main aim of ensuring the reliability of communication as well as of minimizing other factors, such as the number of SMS messages sent and the energy required to perform such tasks. These characteristics make the protocol we propose suitable for data communication when the only network coverage available is the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and consequently, the SMS is the only facility to exploit. In addition, we address both the constraints arising from the limited energy budget of mobile devices and the security issues emerging in this context.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2014 Eighth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS 2014)","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","year":"2014","title":"An Efficient Protocol for Reliable Data Communication on Dataless Devices","author":"Castiglione, Arcangelo and Pizzolante, Raffaele and Carpentieri, Bruno and DE SANTIS, Alfredo","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4586057"},{"pages":"602--607","isbn":"978-1-4799-4325-8","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2014.86","keywords":"Text analysis; natural language processing; aeronautical certification","abstract":"Software certification is one of the major issue in the aeronautical domain.

In particular, in order to get knowledge about their real behavior and define dependability improvement actions, such complex and distributed systems should be reproduced and simulated locally. On the other hand, the extraordinary large number of their components cause a large-scale of the resulting model, limiting its resolution by current simulators. This paper presents a framework to implement hybrid simulation of distributed large-scale critical infrastructures, such as Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Vessel Traffic System (VTS). High Level Architecture (HLA) has been introduced into the engine simulations platform as its design and development foundation, whereas cloud-based virtualization techniques have been exploited in order to reproduce the overall distributed system on a local adaptive testbed. The use of such a framework can result in a considerable reduction of costs in all the system life phases, as well as an increased system dependability level.","booktitle":"International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCOS 2014)","publisher":"IEEE Press","year":"2014","title":"Hybrid Simulation of Distributed Large-Scale Critical Infrastructures","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Avolio, G and Battaglia, L and Manetti, V.","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4776141"},{"pages":"1--8","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2986","keywords":"Embedded systems; Testing; Semantic discovery","abstract":"Testing is a relevant activity for the development life-cycle of Safety Critical Embedded systems.

Several widespread technologies for digital imaging, such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR), etc., produce three-dimensional images. Data compression, is thus essential to reduce the volume of such images, permitting their efficient storing along with the improvement of the relative transmission time through Internet or any other ad-hoc systems, like Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), Tele-radiology, etc.. Since these images are often stored in system particularly vulnerable from the point of view of security, especially because they contain sensitive data, it is necessary to provide such images with a mechanism which ensures at least security against message forgery. In fact, an attack can be made by altering a medical image, and consequently, may alter the relative diagnosis. The purpose of this work is twofold, first we propose a low complexity approach for the compression of 3-D medical images, then, in order to limit the above defined potential attack, we proposed en efficient method to insert within each image an invisible digital watermark, during the compression process. In this way, we define a hybrid approach that handles simultaneously and efficiently both the compression that the security of three-dimensional images. We validate the proposed approach by showing test results.","booktitle":"Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), 2013 Eighth International Conference on","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","year":"2013","title":"A Secure Low Complexity Approach for Compression and Transmission of 3-D Medical Images","author":"Pizzolante, Raffaele and Carpentieri, Bruno and Castiglione, Arcangelo","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4585457"},{"pages":"432--439","isbn":"978-1-4799-3035-7","doi":"10.1109/SYNASC.2013.63","abstract":"Today the main limit to Cloud adoption is related to the perception of a security loss the users have.

In the proposed system, a portable device knows only the address of the server (repository), and the repository sends to the portable device the list of the clients (nodes) which are connected with one or more cameras. When the portable device obtains the list of the nodes, it connects directly to a specific node and requests the images of its connected cameras. The whole system provides secure communication channel between all its components. The security of both the node-repository and the repository-portable devices communications is guaranteed by using a secure connection. The security of the node-portable devices interconnection is provided by a digital invisible watermarking algorithm that affects each image before sending it from the node to the portable devices.

In particular, it is used to detect and filter \"relevant\" symptoms useful for fault diagnosis in a SCADA infrastructure.","booktitle":"European Workshop on Dependable Computing (EWDC 2011)","year":"2011","title":"An Event Correlation Approach for Fault Diagnosis in SCADA Infrastructures","author":"Ficco, M and Daidone, A and Coppolino, L and Romano, L and Bondavalli, A","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4776202"},{"pages":"691--697","isbn":"9780769545790","doi":"10.1109/INCoS.2011.62","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INCoS.2011.62","booktitle":"Third IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems","address":"New York","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","year":"2011","title":"Characterizing and Classifying Card-Sharing Traffic Through Wavelet Analysis","author":"Castiglione, Aniello and DE SANTIS, Alfredo and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_3081061"},{"pages":"1--6","isbn":"978-1-61284-232-5","doi":"10.1109/icc.2011.5962432","booktitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), 2011","year":"2011","title":"Energy-Aware RWA for WDM Networks with Dual Power Sources","author":"Ricciardi, S. and Careglio, D. and Palmieri, Francesco and Fiore, Ugo and Santos Boada, G. and Sol\u00e9 Pareta, J.","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4657135"},{"pages":"344--358","isbn":"9783642232992","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-23300-5_27","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23300-5_27","booktitle":"Availability, Reliability and Security for Business, Enterprise and Health Information Systems - Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 6908","volume":"LNCS 6908","address":"Berlin Heidelberg","publisher":"Springer Verlag","year":"2011","title":"New Steganographic Techniques for the OOXML File Format","author":"Castiglione, Aniello and D'Alessio, Bonaventura and DE SANTIS, Alfredo and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_3032028"},{"pages":"374--379","isbn":"978-0-7695-4532-5","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2011.66","booktitle":"Proceedings 6th International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), 2011","year":"2011","title":"Evaluating Network-Based DoS Attacks Under the Energy Consumption Perspective: New security issues in the coming green ICT area","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Ricciardi, S. and Fiore, Ugo","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4657224"},{"pages":"244--249","isbn":"978-1-4244-6857-7","doi":"10.1109/ISWPC.2010.5483729","url":"http://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-77954765700&origin=resultslist","keywords":"Positioning; Agents; Mobile devices","abstract":"Pervasiveness of electronic devices and networks allows to design ubiquitous services, which use distributed sensors as their extensions.

SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the most significant of such threats. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","booktitle":"IEEE Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing","year":"2009","title":"A Weight-Based Symptom Correlation Approach to SQL Injection Attacks","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Coppolino, L and Romano, L.","ENTRYTYPE":"conference","ID":"11386_4776154"},{"pages":"281--286","isbn":"978-1-4244-4672-8","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202259","booktitle":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, 2009.

Traditionally deploying the reference points and building the Radio Map require human intervention and are extremely time-consuming. In this paper we aim to reduce these manual calibration efforts.

Moreover, installing and tuning systems that rely on such location methods may be quite a complex operation. In this paper we propose a software architecture that makes a combined use of indoor and outdoor location-sensing technologies. On top of the architecture there is a generic API, aimed at supporting the development of hybrid (indoor/outdoor) applications at a high level of abstraction, independent of the location technology. The API is meant to support applications for which the exact position of a mobile terminal is not a primary requirement, but it suffices to identify the terminal position in a known set of zones (e.g., rooms indoor, or pre-defined outdoor areas). The software architecture is designed: i) to ensure compliance with emerging positioning standards and commercial devices, in order to leverage the interoperability with third-party developed services, and ii) to be based on low-cost and easily deployable and tunable indoor positioning infrastructures.

Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be. In this work we investigate the possibility to determine when the earthquake will take place.\n\nWe formulate the problem as a multiple change-point detection in the time series. In particular, we refer to the multi-scale formulation described in Fryzlewicz (Ann Stat 46(6B): 3390\u20133421, 2018). In that paper a bottom-up hierarchical structure is defined. At each stage, multiple neighbor regions which are recognized to correspond to locally constant underlying signal are merged. Due to their multi-scale structure, wavelets are suitable as basis functions, since the coefficients of the representation contain local information. The preprocessing stage involves the discrete unbalanced Haar transform, which is a wavelet decomposition of one-dimensional data with respect to an orthonormal Haar-like basis, where jumps in the basis vectors do not necessarily occur in the middle of their support.\n\nThe algorithm is tested on data from a well-characterized laboratory system described in Rouet-Leduc et al. (Geophys Res Lett 44(18): 9276\u20139282, 2017).","booktitle":"Dynamics of Disasters.

In particular, in safety-critical systems consistency between software requirements and safety analysis requires checks to guarantee that safety engineer needs are feasible and implemented by the system. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic technique to analyze the failure modes of components, evaluating their impact and their mitigation actions, which are procedures to be implemented by operators or by the system itself (usually by the software). Although the actual efforts to centralize system information in a structured way, safety analysis is not tied in a structured manner to other systems, in particular to software. This paper proposes an automatic approach to check consistency between FMEA and software requirements with a bit effort of formalization. The approach models FMEA and software requirements with Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets and checks their consistency on the basis of consistency rules.","booktitle":"Studies in Computational Intelligence","volume":"616","publisher":"Springer Verlag","year":"2016","title":"A semantic driven approach for consistency verification between requirements and FMEA","author":"Gigante, Gabriella and Gargiulo, Francesco and Ficco, Massimo and Pascarella, Domenico","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4776172"},{"pages":"229--238","isbn":"978-3-319-22920-1","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-22921-8_18","keywords":"Cloud security; service level agreement; economic denial of sustainability; intrusion prevention; attack mitigation","abstract":"Cloud Computing is a large-set of resources and services offered through the Internet according to a on-demand self service model.

It is an opportunity for IT users to reduce costs and increase efficiency providing an alternative way of using IT services. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way and a business model for selling computing resources. It gives to small and medium enterprises the possibility of using services and technologies that were prerogative of large ones, by paying only for the resources needed and avoiding upfront investment. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use resources and services on the base of a pay-per-use model, implies incredible flexibility in terms of management, which is otherwise often hard to address. On the other hand, because of this flexibility new problems emerge, which involve the evaluation and monitoring of the quality of the acquired resources and services.

Completeness results is the most difficult property to guarantee. It is hard to capture the software behavior against the whole external context.

The adoption of ontologies seems promising to achieve the proper level of formalism and to argue on quality properties. This paper presents a survey of the main concepts that need to be accounted for requirement verification, and proposes an ontological engineering approach to demonstrate the overlapping of requirements against the external context.","booktitle":"Intelligent Distributed Computing VIII","volume":"570","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","year":"2015","title":"A Semantic Driven Approach for Requirements Verification","author":"Gigante, G and Gargiulo, F and Ficco, Massimo","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4776185"},{"pages":"865--872","isbn":"9781479920723","doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2014.6891810","keywords":"Theoretical Computer Science; Software; Artificial Intelligence; Applied Mathematics","booktitle":"IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","year":"2014","title":"A fuzzy logic based reputation system for E-markets","author":"Acampora, Giovanni and Castiglione, Arcangelo and Vitiello, Autilia","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4682211"},{"pages":"0--0","isbn":"978-3-319-06263-1","booktitle":"Modeling and Processing for Next-Generation Big-Data Technologies","publisher":"Springer","year":"2014","title":"How the big data is leading the evolution of ICT technologies and processes","author":"Scarfo, Antonio and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4646781"},{"pages":"189--196","isbn":"9781479963867","doi":"10.1109/INCoS.2014.115","keywords":"Cranial disorders; collaborative healthcare; collaborative diagnosis; decision support; automatic analysis; security; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Networks and Communications","booktitle":"Proceedings - 2014 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, IEEE INCoS 2014","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","year":"2014","title":"A collaborative decision-support system for secure analysis of cranial disorders","author":"Castiglione, Arcangelo and Pizzolante, Raffaele and DE SANTIS, Alfredo and D'Ambrosio, Ciriaco","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4682210"},{"pages":"243--248","isbn":"978-3-319-01570-5","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-01571-2_29","url":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-01571-2_29","abstract":"Cloud Federation is an emerging computing model where multiple resources\nfrom independent Cloud providers are leveraged to create large-scale distributed vir-\ntual computing clusters, operating as within a single Cloud organization.

Implementations of this specification may rely on several location methods, including satellite based methods like GPS, as well as short-range positioning methods based on Received Signal Strength (RSS). Though RSS is a good location fingerprint for indoor positioning, no standard technique to tailor RSS-based approaches to the JSR-179 API has been proposed yet. In this paper we propose such a technique, and we evaluate its effectiveness through a Bluetooth-based prototype. Specifically, we show how to extend the Java APIs for Bluetooth (JSR-82) in order to provide the Location API with RSS-based position-information. Moreover, we show how to adapt RSS-based approaches to Location-API's semantics. Our solution is based on the insertion of a specific component into the JSR-82 API. This is in charge of producing all the information needed to build Location objects as defined in the JSR-179. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach by examining preliminary experimental results obtained from the first system prototype.","booktitle":"Java Technologies for Real-Time and Embedded Systems (JTRES 2004)","volume":"3292","publisher":"SPRINGER","year":"2004","title":"Indoor Positioning for Location-Aware Applications on Java-based Mobile Devices","author":"DI FLORA, C. and Ficco, Massimo and Russo, S.","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4776136"},{"pages":"882--894","isbn":"3-540-22054-2","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-24707-4_101","booktitle":"Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2004, Lecture Notes in Computer Science","volume":"3043","publisher":"Springer Berlin / Heidelberg","year":"2004","title":"A Scalable PKI for Secure Routing in the Internet","author":"Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4646760"},{"pages":"301--313","isbn":"3-540-22262-6","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-25969-5_27","booktitle":"High Speed Networks and Multimedia Communications,Lecture Notes in Computer Science","volume":"3079","publisher":"Springer Berlin / Heidelberg","year":"2004","title":"MPLS DiffServ-Enabled Traffic Engineering: A Scalable QoS Model for Optical-Speed Media Streaming Networks","author":"Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4646804"},{"pages":"142--155","isbn":"3-540-20298-6","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-39646-8_14","booktitle":"Mobile Agents for Telecommunication Applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science","volume":"2881","publisher":"Springer Berlin / Heidelberg","year":"2003","title":"Introducing MPLS in Mobile Data Networks: An High Performance Framework for QoS-Powered IP Mobility","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Fiore, Ugo","ENTRYTYPE":"inbook","ID":"11386_4646766"}],"article":[{"pages":"1--21","doi":"10.1016/j.csi.2024.103887","keywords":"Access control; Blockchain; Consensus mechanism; Dynamic searchable encryption; Port supply chain; Smart contracts","volume":"91","journal":"COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES","year":"2025","title":"A secure data storage and sharing scheme for port supply chain based on blockchain and dynamic searchable encryption","author":"Jiatao, Li and Han, Dezhi and Weng, Tien-Hsiung and Huafeng, Wu and Kuan-Ching, Li and Castiglione, Arcangelo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4892239"},{"pages":"1--17","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2024.121559","keywords":"Network activity correlation\nAnonymity\nOverlay networks\nWasserstein distance","abstract":"As the effectiveness of modern Internet-based anonymization infrastructures grows, law enforcement agencies are experiencing a progressive erosion of their surveillance capabilities. This can severely undermine their efforts to prevent and investigate various types of unlawful activities, potentially increasing the impunity of organized criminal networks. Balancing the legitimate privacy needs of individuals with the imperative to maintain public safety and combat criminal behavior in the digital world remains a complex tradeoff for both policymakers and technologists who need to find a systematic and reliable way to link the traffic traces associated with criminal activities to their anonymized origins. Accordingly, this paper presents a simple but very effective de-anonymization approach capable of associating traffic traces captured at the edge of the overlay infrastructures, in correspondence with the true origins, to those captured in correspondence with the destinations. The approach is based on determining the minimum-distance pairs within a complete bipartite graph in which the traffic traces are the nodes. Experiments with different distance functions, applied in varied ways, show that the resulting framework appears to be a promising solution that is scalable and easily deployable on real-life network equipment.","volume":"690","journal":"INFORMATION SCIENCES","year":"2025","title":"A distance-based network activity correlation framework for defeating anonymization overlays","author":"Fiore, U. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4887027"},{"number":"9-10","pages":"1--14","doi":"10.1007/s00500-023-09553-3","journal":"SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2024","title":"DSTGCS: an intelligent dynamic spatial\u2013temporal graph convolutional system for traffic flow prediction in ITS","author":"Hu, N. and Zhang, D. and Liang, W. and Li, K. -C. and Castiglione, A.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4854331"},{"pages":"1--13","doi":"10.1109/TCSS.2024.3492097","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10758294","keywords":"Fake news, Mathematical models, Analytical models, Numerical models, Social networking(online), Epidemics, Differential equations, Biological system modeling, Predictive models, Computational modeling","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS","year":"2024","title":"Generalized Defensive Modeling of Fake News Propagation in Social Networks Using Fractional Differential Equations","author":"De Santis, Alfredo and Farsimadan, Eslam and Moradi, Leila and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4891224"},{"pages":"112159--112159","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112159","keywords":"Evolutionary algorithms;

Most of the solutions in the literature address these aspects by considering a fixed load for each controller and attempting to equally distribute the traffic demand of the switches among the controllers, which also have a fixed common capacity. On the contrary, in this work, the CPP is studied by considering load, controller capacity, and the failure probability of controllers and links as varying over time. The CPP is formulated in terms of a robust optimization problem, which, by introducing the concept of scenario, takes into account changes in the network status due to failures, load variations, and changes in switches\u2019 demand and controllers\u2019 capacity. The provided solution is robust, that is, neither controllers\u2019 re-placement nor switches\u2019 re-assignment is required as network conditions change. Besides, a co-evolutionary algorithm is provided to solve the aforementioned optimization problem. Two populations coevolve based on the concept of complementary evolution of allied species in nature. Experimental results on a set of real-world network topologies and comparisons with the state-of-the-art have proven the superiority of the proposal, in terms of better latency, load balancing and resilience, in solving the CPP under different network status changes that might occur over time.","volume":"212","journal":"JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS","year":"2023","title":"A co-evolutionary genetic algorithm for robust and balanced controller placement in software-defined networks","author":"D'Angelo, G. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4828572"},{"pages":"106851--106861","doi":"10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106851","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523003165","keywords":"Driver identification; ECG; EMG; Multi-2D TF image; Multi-modal biometrics","volume":"159","journal":"COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE","year":"2023","title":"Multi-modal Biometrics Based Implicit Driver Identification System Using Multi-TF Images of ECG and EMG","author":"Choi, Gyuho and Ziyang, Gong and Jingyi, Wu and Esposito, Christian and Choi, Chang","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4833931"},{"pages":"3277--3288","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2023.3278449","keywords":"Denial of Service; Internet of Things; Markov model; recovery; Survivability","volume":"18","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY","year":"2023","title":"Survivability Analysis of IoT Systems Under Resource Exhausting Attacks","author":"Pietrantuono, R. and Ficco, M. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4839292"},{"number":"19","pages":"4825--4839","doi":"10.3390/cancers15194825","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/19/4825","keywords":"cell signaling; monoclonal antibodies; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; secretome; small molecules; tumor microenvironment","abstract":": Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a ravaging disease with a poor prognosis, requiring a more detailed understanding of its biology to foster the development of effective therapies.

In addition, since such models are often trained on confidential application data, many involved subjects are reluctant to share their data for this purpose. Accordingly, several Federated Learning-based solutions are emerging, which rely on the capabilities of Machine Learning models in malware detection/classification without sharing user data. However, Federated Learning methods are often adversely affected by non-independent and identically distributed data in terms of both the required training time and classification results. Therefore, a promising solution could be to overcome the Federated Learning-related issues by preserving the privacy of end-user data. In this direction, the capabilities of Markov chains and associative rules are extended within a federated environment to face malware classification tasks in the IoT scenario. The presented approach, evaluated on several malware families, has achieved an average accuracy of 99% in the presence of centralized and decentralized unbalanced training/testing data by overcoming the most common state-of-the-art approaches.

Stringent measures have been adopted to face the pandemic, such as complete lockdown, shutting down businesses and trade, as well as travel restrictions. Nevertheless, such solutions have had a tremendous economic impact. Although the use of recent vaccines seems to reduce the scale of the problem, the pandemic does not appear to finish soon. Therefore, having a forecasting model about the COVID-19 spread is of paramount importance to plan interventions and, then, to limit the economic and social damage. In this paper, we use Genetic Programming to evidence dependences of the SARS-CoV-2 spread from past data in a given Country. Namely, we analyze real data of the Campania Region, in Italy. The resulting models prove their effectiveness in forecasting the number of new positives 10/15&nbsp;days before, with quite a high accuracy. The developed models have been integrated into the context of SVIMAC-19, an analytical-forecasting system for the containment, contrast, and monitoring of Covid-19 within the Campania Region.","volume":"26","journal":"SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2022","title":"Forecasting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the campania region using genetic programming","author":"D'Angelo, Gianni and Rampone, Salvatore","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4806716"},{"number":"3","pages":"1213--1240","doi":"10.2298/CSIS211105024L","keywords":"Cross-organizational secure cooperation; Blockchain; Gantt chart; Project management; Hyperledger fabric; Data sharing","volume":"19","journal":"COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","year":"2022","title":"Fabric-GC: A Blockchain-based Gantt chart system for cross-organizational project management","author":"Dun, Li and Han, Dezhi and Xia, Benhui and Weng, Tien-Hsiung and Castiglione, Arcangelo and Kuan-Ching, Li","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4854795"},{"number":"121763","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121763","keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Econometric models; Policy; Regulation; Trust","volume":"181","journal":"TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE","year":"2022","title":"To trust or not to trust?

Such a multi-tenant deployment model is required to lower the initial investment costs to implement large scale solutions for smart cities, but also imposes some key security obstacles. In fact, smart cities support critical applications demanding to protect the data and functionalities from malicious and unauthorized uses. Equipping the supporting platforms with proper means for access control is demanding, but these means are typically implemented according to a centralized approach, where a single server stores and makes available a set of identity attributes and authorization policies. Having a single root of trust is not suitable in a distributed and cooperating scenario of large scale smart cities due to their multi-tenant deployment. In fact, each of the integrated system has its own set of security policies, and the other systems need to be aware of these policy, in order to allow a seamless use of the same credentials across the overall infrastructure (realizing what is known as the single-sign-on). This imposes the problem of consistent and secure data replicas within a distributed system, which can be properly approached by using the blockchain technology. Therefore, this work proposes a novel solution for distributed management of identity and authorization policies by leveraging on the blockchain technology to hold a global view of the security policies within the system, and integrating it in the FIWARE platform. A detailed assessment is provided to evaluate the goodness of the proposed approach and to compare it with the existing solutions.","volume":"58","journal":"INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT","year":"2021","title":"Blockchain-based authentication and authorization for smart city applications","author":"Esposito, Christian and Ficco, Massimo and Gupta, Brij Bhooshan","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4755882"},{"number":"11","doi":"10.3390/fi13110269","keywords":"Convolutional networks; Embarrassingly parallel; Hyperparameters; Optimization","volume":"13","journal":"FUTURE INTERNET","year":"2021","title":"Covidnet: Implementing parallel architecture on sound and image for high efficacy","author":"Murugappan, M. and Thomas, J.

It is considered a tremendous boost to company digitalization; thus, considerable investments in blockchain are being made. However, there is no single blockchain technology, but various solutions exist, and they cannot interoperate with one each other. The ecosystem envisioned by the Industry 4.0 does not have centralized management or leading organization, so a single blockchain solution cannot be imposed. The various organizations hold their own blockchains, which must interoperate seamlessly. Despite some solutions for blockchain interoperability being proposed, the problem is still open. This paper aims to devise a secure solution for blockchain interoperability. The proposed approach consists of a relay scheme based on Trusted Execution Environment to provide higher security guarantees than the current literature. In particular, the proposed solution adopts an off-chain secure computation element invoked by a smart contract on a blockchain to securely communicate with its peered counterpart. A prototype has been implemented and used for the performance assessment, e.g., to measure the latency increase due to cross-blockchain interactions. The achieved and reported experimental results show that the proposed security solution introduces an additional latency that is entirely tolerable for transactions.

Typically, companies hold massive amounts of data within their servers, which might include previously offered services, proposals, bids, and so on. They rely on their expert managers to manually analyse them in order to make strategic decisions. However, given the huge amount of information to be analysed and the necessity of making timely decisions, they often exploit a small amount of the available data, which often does not yield effective choices. For instance, this happens in the context of the e-procurement domain, where bids for new calls for tender are often formulated by looking at some past proposals from a company. Driven by an extensive experience on the e-procurement domain, in this paper we propose an intelligent system to support organisations in the focused crawling of artefacts (calls for tender, BIMs, equipment, policies, market trends, and so on) of interest from the web, semantically matching them against internal Big Data and knowledge sources, so as to let companies analysts make better strategic decisions. The novel contribution consists of a proper extension of the K-means algorithm used by a web crawler within the proposed system, and a semantic module exploiting search patterns to find relevant data within the crawled artefacts. The proposed solution has been implemented and extensively assessed in the e-procurement domain. It has been successively extended to other domains, such as robot programming, cloud providing, and several other domains. Since to the best of our knowledge in the literature do not exists similar systems, in order to prove its effectiveness we have compared its crawling component against similar crawlers, by plugging them within our system.","volume":"184","journal":"EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS","year":"2021","title":"An intelligent system for focused crawling from Big Data sources","author":"Bifulco, Ida and Cirillo, Stefano and Esposito, Christian and Guadagni, Roberta and Polese, Giuseppe","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4767540"},{"pages":"102890--102905","doi":"10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102890","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804520303519","keywords":"Network traffic classification; Features extraction; Long Short-Term Memory; Recurrent neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; ConvLSTM","volume":"173","journal":"JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS","year":"2021","title":"Network traffic classification using deep convolutional recurrent autoencoder neural networks for spatial\u2013temporal features extraction","author":"D\u2019Angelo, Gianni and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4753263"},{"number":"7","doi":"10.3390/app11073278","keywords":"Assembly assistance system; Industry 4.0; Prediction by partial matching; Smart factory; Training station","volume":"11","journal":"APPLIED SCIENCES","year":"2021","title":"An empirical evaluation of prediction by partial matching in assembly assistance systems","author":"Gellert, A. and Precup, S. -A. and Pirvu, B. -C. and Fiore, U. and Zamfirescu, C. -B. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4780483"},{"pages":"107234--107234","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107234","keywords":"API call sequence; Association rules; Machine learning; Malware dynamic analysis; Markov chains; Sequence alignment","volume":"105","journal":"APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2021","title":"Association rule-based malware classification using common subsequences of API calls","author":"D'Angelo, G. and Ficco, M. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4763326"},{"number":"16","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2020.3032935","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9235336","keywords":"Internet of vehicles, Controller Area Network security, Intrusion detection, Machine Learning, Clustering, K-means.","journal":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","year":"2020","title":"A Cluster-based Multidimensional Approach for Detecting Attacks on Connected Vehicles","author":"D'Angelo, Gianni and Castiglione, Arcangelo and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4763863"},{"number":"6","pages":"1--15","doi":"10.1109/TEM.2020.3024105","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9210080","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT","year":"2020","title":"FUSION\u2014Fog Computing and Blockchain for Trusted Industrial Internet of Things","author":"Ceccarelli, Andrea and Cinque, Marcello and Esposito, Christian and Foschini, Luca and Giannelli, Carlo and Lollini, Paolo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4750945"},{"number":"12","pages":"8751--8761","doi":"10.1007/s00500-020-04910-y","keywords":"MV-algebra; Pseudofiniteness; Definable wellfoundedness","volume":"24","journal":"SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2020","title":"A characterization of pseudofinite MV-algebras","author":"Farsimadan, E. and Lenzi, G. and Rizzo, P. and Saeid, A.

This opportunistic behavior causes the impossibility of defining valid security policies to rule node authorization, and the ineffectiveness of traditional static access control models based on roles or attributes. Trust management is a promising solution to complement these conventional rules and models by realizing a more dynamic security approach and regulating connection request acceptance or rejection based on monitored behaviors. As a centralized authority cannot be established within multi-tenant and large scale infrastructures, decentralized approaches have recently emerged, supported by the blockchain technology, and applied to the case of useful Internet of Things implementations. However, they are vulnerable to possible attacks aiming at discrediting honest nodes (by lowering their trust degree) and/or redeem malicious nodes (by increasing their trust degree). The widely-accepted protection consists of securing the communications by using SSL/TLS, and restricting the nodes allowed to update the trust degree. However, they are known to be ineffective against compromised nodes that, despite holding legitimate security claims and cryptographic material, they deviate from the correct behavior by sending false and mendacious scores. This work proposes to exploit on game theory to realize robust decentralized trust management able to tolerate malicious nodes sending mendacious scores. Explicitly, a signaling node has been formalized to model the interactions between the IoT and the edge nodes by refusing potentially untrue scores. Moreover, the evolutionary Dempster-Shafer theory is used to combine the collected scores to update nodes\u2019 trust degrees, by excluding diverging scores far from the majority. Such solutions have been implemented within the context of a blockchain-supported trust management solution for IoT, and an empirical assessment is provided to show the quality of the proposed approach.","volume":"57","journal":"INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT","year":"2020","title":"Robust Decentralised Trust Management for the Internet of Things by Using Game Theory","author":"Esposito, Christiancarmine and Tamburis, Oscar and Xin, Su and Choi, Chang","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4747380"},{"number":"21","pages":"16453--16482","doi":"10.1007/s00500-020-04954-0","keywords":"Localized weather forecasting; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Precision farming; Temporal convolution networks (TCN); Time-series data analysis","volume":"24","journal":"SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2020","title":"Temporal convolutional neural (TCN) network for an effective weather forecasting using time-series data from the local weather station","author":"Hewage, P. and Behera, A. and Trovati, M. and Pereira, E. and Ghahremani, M. and Palmieri, F. and Liu, Y.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4756731"},{"number":"23","pages":"1--26","doi":"10.1002/cpe.5935","keywords":"anonymity; private browsing; the onion router; TOR; Tor browser; Web browser forensics","volume":"33","journal":"CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION","year":"2020","title":"A machine learning\u2010based memory forensics methodology for TOR browser artifacts","author":"Pizzolante, Raffaele and Castiglione, Arcangelo and Carpentieri, Bruno and Contaldo, Roberto and D'Angelo, Gianni and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4859731"},{"number":"2","pages":"160--160","doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2019.2912154","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9113129","volume":"5","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING","year":"2020","title":"Editorial: IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing, Special Issue on Cryptography and Data Security in Sustainable Computing (Part 1)","author":"Andersson, Karl and Chen, Xiaofeng and Esposito, Christian and Rondeau, Eric","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4748912"},{"pages":"106722--106737","doi":"10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106722","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790620305772?dgcid=author","keywords":"Trust management; Blockchain; Decentralized trust assessment; Fog computing","volume":"86","journal":"COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING","year":"2020","title":"Blockchain-empowered decentralised trust management for the Internet of Vehicles security","author":"Cinque, Marcello and Esposito, Christian and Russo, Stefano and Tamburis, Oscar","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4747416"},{"number":"8","pages":"1--16","doi":"10.1002/cpe.5322","keywords":"advanced steganography systems; compressed archives; data protection; forensics; innovative security; secret data management","volume":"32","journal":"CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION","year":"2020","title":"Compression-based steganography","author":"Carpentieri, B. and Castiglione, A. and De Santis, A. and Palmieri, F. and Pizzolante, R.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4743636"},{"pages":"393--404","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2019.08.075","url":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-sciences/","keywords":"MPEG-CDVS Standard; Secure data streaming; Security; Ubiquitous computing; Visual search techniques; Watermarking","volume":"508","journal":"INFORMATION SCIENCES","year":"2020","title":"Securing visual search queries in ubiquitous scenarios empowered by smart personal devices","author":"Carpentieri, B. and Castiglione, A. and De Santis, A. and Palmieri, F. and Pizzolante, R. and Xing, X.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4731144"},{"number":"11","pages":"1680--1698","doi":"10.1002/int.22268","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/int.22268","keywords":"common subsequence; coronavirus; COVID-19; dynamic programming; genomic patterns; genomic variants; pattern recognition; SARS-CoV-2; sequence analysis; spike protein","volume":"35","journal":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS","year":"2020","title":"Discovering genomic patterns in SARS-CoV-2 variants","author":"D'Angelo, G. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4752845"},{"number":"10","doi":"10.1002/jbio.202000138","keywords":"anterior segment-optical coherence tomography; corneal densitometry; corneal epithelial thickness; photorefractive keratectomy; scheimpflug imaging system","journal":"JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS","year":"2020","title":"Evaluation of corneal structures in myopic eyes more than twenty-two years after photorefractive keratectomy","author":"Montorio, D. and Cennamo, G. and Menna, F. and Donna, P. and Napolitano, P. and Breve, M.

In order to analyze some specific processes of an ophthalmology ward of a large Italian hospital, ProM6 framework was implemented, which supports process mining techniques in form of plug-ins; the plug-ins process data, in form of Event Log, in order to extract information about the process. The DES model based on such information was run via a commercial tool, Simul8, which allows building sophisticated process models. A timely algorithm was then deployed to adapt the ProM6 information to the DES model. Following, a conformance analysis was conducted by comparing the original Event Log, and the Simulation tool data, taking into account the main case-related model attributes (routing probabilities profile, time perspective, and resources perspective). The paper aims at developing the line of inquiry for what concerns the deployment of approaches to set forth the link between Process mining and Simulation modeling.","volume":"104","journal":"SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY","year":"2020","title":"Process mining as support to simulation modeling: A hospital-based case study","author":"Tamburis, Oscar and Esposito, Christian","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4748910"},{"pages":"26--33","doi":"10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.11.001","keywords":"Android; Autoencoders; Deep learning; Dynamic analysis; Malware","volume":"137","journal":"JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING","year":"2020","title":"Malware detection in mobile environments based on Autoencoders and API-images","author":"D'Angelo, G. and Ficco, M. and Palmieri, F.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4746272"},{"pages":"167123--167163","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022661","volume":"8","journal":"IEEE ACCESS","year":"2020","title":"Security, Privacy and Trust for Smart Mobile- Internet of Things (M-IoT): A Survey","author":"Sharma, Vishal and You, Ilsun and Andersson, Karl and Palmieri, Francesco and Rehmani, Mubashir Husain and Lim, Jaedeok","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4756736"},{"pages":"439--452","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2018.06.003","keywords":"Internet of things; Smart buildings; Optimization; Energy Comfort; ILP; Simulation","abstract":"The incremented popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to improvements both in hardware and software of sensors over the last years, enables the possibility to monitor and gather any kind of data. Additionally, the arrangement of heterogeneous sensors, capable of perceiving information about their surroundings, into a rich Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) allows the appearance of complex systems in which resources are managed more efficiently. Smart cities, buildings, parkings, emergency services are appearing, where control over energy consumption and better sustainability are coupled with an improvement of the comfort of occupants. In this paper, we address the problem of energy optimization in smart buildings, considering both the planning and operational aspects. Specifically, the first aim is to propose an optimal deployment of the WSN inside a building. For this, we present a model able to identify the optimal locations for different types of sensors and gateways, by optimizing energy consumption while fulfilling connectivity, resource, protection, and clustering coverage constraints. Once the IoT system is deployed, we address the problem of how the building actually functions, according to the behaviour of the occupants. In particular, we propose a Building Management System (BMS) capable of efficiently and automatically manage the building elements using human behavioural models, thus lowering the overall building energy consumption whilst maintaining acceptable levels of comfort.","volume":"476","journal":"INFORMATION SCIENCES","year":"2019","title":"Planning and operational energy optimization solutions for smart buildings","author":"Sembroiz, David and Careglio, Davide and Ricciardi, Sergio and Fiore, Ugo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4780481"},{"pages":"627--636","doi":"10.1016/j.future.2018.10.056","keywords":"Complex networks; Label propagation; Link prediction; Network dynamics; Software; Hardware and Architecture; Computer Networks and Communications","volume":"93","journal":"FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS","year":"2019","title":"Distributed temporal link prediction algorithm based on label propagation","author":"Xiaolong, Xu and Nan, Hu and Tao, Li and Trovati, Marcello and Palmieri, Francesco and Kontonatsios, Georgios and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4722362"},{"pages":"123--131","doi":"10.1016/j.patrec.2018.02.015","url":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition-letters/","keywords":"Anti-spoofing; Biometric recognition; Convolutional neural networks; Information security","volume":"126","journal":"PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS","year":"2019","title":"CNN-based anti-spoofing two-tier multi-factor authentication system","author":"Sajjad, M. and Khan, S. and Hussain, T. and Muhammad, K. and Sangaiah, A.

Chronic glaucoma therapy containing benzalkonium chloride induces epithelial cellular changes and inflammatory infiltration that in turn causes ocular surface changes resulting in ocular discomfort. Also age-related changes can involve the tear film stability and the corneal epithelium surface with reduction of microvilli. The objective of this study is to gain insights about the changes in corneal epithelium in glaucomatous patients divided according to age, type and duration of therapy using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). This study evaluated a total of 81 eyes of 42 patients for whom corneal epithelium thickness (CET) was measured in different sectors of the cornea. Our results showed no significant differences in CET among patients divided according to type and duration of treatment, while younger patients showed a thinner CET in comparison with older patients. AS-OCT results demonstrated that the physiological age-related alterations contributed to corneal epithelium changes in patients undergo chronic antiglaucoma therapy.

The proposed methodology assigns various ranks to cloud services based on the quantified quality-of-service parameters using a novel extended Grey Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution integrated with analytical hierarchical process.

The proposed architecture, particularly well suited to the special needs of knowledge-based organizations, is articulated into a framework able to manage cases where data is missing and an adaptive scoring algorithm takes into account seniority, performance, and performance evolution trends, allowing employee evaluation over longer periods. We developed a flexible software tool that gathers data from organizations in an automatic way \u2013 through adapted connectors \u2013 and generates abundant results on the measurement and distribution of employees\u2019 performances. The main challenges of human resource departments \u2013 quantification of human resource performance, analysis of the distribution of performance, and early identification of employees willing to leave the workforce \u2013 are handled through the proposed IT platform.

As a result, it is difficult to determine a univocal architecture to identify as a reference and several scenarios, involving different sensors, smart devices, networks or gateways, can unfold. The data exchanged within and among IoT frameworks are growing exponentially, and the pervasiveness of such systems brings them to come in possession of very sensitive information: as a consequence, Security and Privacy have become a hot topic on the IoT scenery. Furthermore, due to the great variety of technological solutions which are currently available, interoperability issues are bound to arise, especially when no standard API interface, or communication protocol, has been officially adopted. This paper provides a review of the most common architectural solutions available to- day to shape an IoT system, ranging from already standardized architecture to commercial ones. Elements from such architectures have been compared, analysed and mapped one against the other to determine a stable reference for Security and Interoperability analysis. Current solutions in the Security and API Interoperability domains for IoT have been also analysed.","volume":"1-2","journal":"INTERNET OF THINGS","year":"2018","title":"Internet of things reference architectures, security and interoperability: A survey","author":"DI MARTINO, Beniamino and Rak, Massimiliano and Ficco, Massimo and Esposito, Antonio and Maisto, Salvatore and Nacchia, Stefania","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776165"},{"number":"4","pages":"821--830","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2018.2792848","keywords":"Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);

Thus, wireless internet service providers are required to take several positioning methods into account at the same time, to leverage the different features of existing technologies. This would allow providing LBSs satisfying the user-required quality of position in terms of accuracy, privacy, power consumption, and often, conflicting features. Therefore, this paper presents GlobalPreLoc, a multi-objective strategy for the dynamic and optimal selection of positioning technologies. The strategy exploits a pattern-mining algorithm for future position prediction combined with conventional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, for choosing continuously the best location providers, accounting for the user requirements, the terminal capabilities, and the surrounding positioning infrastructures. To practically implement the strategy, we also designed an architecture based on secure user plane location specification to provide indoor and outdoor LBSs in interworking wireless networks exploiting GlobalPreLoc features.","volume":"20","journal":"SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2016","title":"Using multi-objective metaheuristics for the optimal selection of positioning systems","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Pietrantuono, Roberto and Russo, Stefano","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776187"},{"number":"5","pages":"10--14","doi":"10.1109/MCC.2016.105","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=6509491","keywords":"cloud computing;

On the other hand, these complex architectures become an attractive target for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Although, federated cloud environments have large amount of resources and profound dynamic allocation capability, which can be used to face DDoS attacks, they are however vulnerable to attacks that aim at compromising the service level agreements. In this paper, we investigate the key research topics for supporting distributed intrusion detection in a federated cloud environment. We propose a scalable intrusion detection solution, which can be used by cloud providers to protect the federated cloud infrastructure, as well as offered to the cloud service providers to monitor the hosted applications. We present a multi-layer architecture, which exploits a publish/subscribe middleware to collect and share security information in the federated cloud infrastructure. Moreover, we present an open-source framework, which provides features and interfaces to develop and deploy security components, as well as to define customised event correlation rules used to detect possible inter-cloud attacks.","volume":"13","journal":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING","year":"2016","title":"Intrusion detection in federated clouds","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Tasquier, Luca and Aversa, Rocco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776158"},{"number":"4","pages":"16--22","doi":"10.1109/MCC.2016.79","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=6509491","keywords":"cloud computing; cloud manufacturing; cryptography; Digital forensics; security; Software; Computer Science (miscellaneous); Computer Science Applications1707 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Networks and Communications","volume":"3","journal":"IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING","year":"2016","title":"Cloud Manufacturing: Security, Privacy, and Forensic Concerns","author":"Esposito, Christiancarmine and Castiglione, Aniello and Martini, Ben and Choo, Kim Kwang Raymond","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4678348"},{"number":"4","pages":"451--460","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2015.2413415","volume":"13","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING","year":"2016","title":"Key Indistinguishability versus Strong Key Indistinguishability for Hierarchical Key Assignment Schemes","author":"Castiglione, Arcangelo and DE SANTIS, Alfredo and Masucci, Barbara","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4673368"},{"number":"2","pages":"400--419","doi":"10.1002/cpe.3472","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1532-0634","keywords":"Critical infrastructures; HLA; Hybrid simulation; Network emulation; Virtualizaton; Computer Networks and Communications; Computer Science Applications1707 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Software; Computational Theory and Mathematics; Theoretical Computer Science","volume":"28","journal":"CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION","year":"2016","title":"An HLA-based framework for simulation of large-scale critical systems","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Avolio, Giovanni and Palmieri, Francesco and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4659692"},{"number":"17","pages":"4378--4390","doi":"10.1002/sec.1614","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-0122","keywords":"Media on demand; Mobile cloud; Payment systems; Security; VANET; Computer Networks and Communications; Information Systems","volume":"9","journal":"SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS","year":"2016","title":"A secure payment system for multimedia on demand on mobile VANET clouds","author":"Chen, Chin Ling and Lin, Yu Fan and Castiglione, Aniello and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4674400"},{"number":"5","pages":"1620--1641","doi":"10.1007/s11227-014-1242-6","volume":"71","journal":"THE JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING","year":"2015","title":"Energy-oriented denial of service attacks: an emerging menace for large cloud infrastructures","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Ricciardi, Sergio and Fiore, Ugo and Ficco, Massimo and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646656"},{"number":"3","pages":"201--211","doi":"10.1504/IJHPCN.2015.071261","keywords":"Requirements Engineering; Semantic Driven Approach; Ontologies","abstract":"Requirements Engineering (RE) is a key discipline for the success of software projects.

An overview of the actual trends in RE is briefly summarized, focusing more closely on the requirements verification quality properties. Completeness results is the most difficult property to guarantee. It is hard to capture the software behavior against the whole external context. In the last years, research has focused its attention to the application of semantic Web techniques to the different tasks of RE. The adoption of ontologies seems promising to achieve the proper level of formalism and to argue on quality properties.

According to this paradigm, the effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks involve not only the quality of the delivered service, but also the service maintenance costs in terms of resource consumption. Specifically, the longer the detection delay is, the higher the costs to be incurred. Therefore, a particular attention has to be paid for stealthy DoS attacks. They aim at minimizing their visibility, and at the same time, they can be as harmful as the brute-force attacks. They are sophisticated attacks tailored to leverage the worst-case performance of the target system through specific periodic, pulsing, and low-rate traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose a strategy to orchestrate stealthy attack patterns, which exhibit a slowly-increasing-intensity trend designed to inflict the maximum financial cost to the cloud customer, while respecting the job size and the service arrival rate imposed by the detection mechanisms. We describe both how to apply the proposed strategy, and its effects on the target system deployed in the cloud.","volume":"3","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CLOUD COMPUTING","year":"2015","title":"Stealthy Denial of Service Strategy in Cloud Computing","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Rak, Massimiliano","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776179"},{"pages":"41--47","doi":"10.1016/j.jnca.2015.06.014","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804515001423","volume":"56","journal":"JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS","year":"2015","title":"Energy efficiency of elastic frequency grids in multilayer IP/MPLS-over-flexgrid networks","author":"Ricciardi, Sergio and Palmieri, Francesco and Castiglione, Aniello and Carreglio, Davide","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4655396"},{"pages":"3--17","doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2014.05.003","volume":"79","journal":"KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS","year":"2015","title":"A knowledge-based platform for Big Data analytics based on publish/subscribe services and stream processing","author":"Esposito, Christiancarmine and Massimo, Ficco and Palmieri, Francesco and Castiglione, Aniello and Ficco, Massimo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646666"},{"number":"2","pages":"231--249","doi":"10.1002/ett.2815","volume":"26(2)","journal":"TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES","year":"2015","title":"An energy-aware engineered control plane for wavelength-routed networks","author":"Ricciardi, Sergio and Wang, Jiayuan and Palmieri, Francesco and Careglio, Davide and Dittman, Lars","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646632"},{"pages":"120--134","keywords":"Data Compression; Cloud computing; Data security","abstract":"Several studies show that the lack of access to resources and shared data is one of the main causes of errors in the healthcare sector.

Therefore, their management, which should be performed also by means of devices with limited characteristics, requires complex network protocols along with advanced compression and security techniques. This work concerns the secure management of 3D medical images, with the main aim that such management must take place in an almost completely transparent manner for the user, regardless of the computational and networking capabilities he may use. In particular, our contribution is twofold: first, we propose an engine for lossless dynamic and adaptive compression of 3D medical images, which also allows the embedding of security watermarks within them. Furthermore, in order to provide effective, secure and flexible access to healthcare resources that need to be managed by medical applications, we define the architecture of a SaaS Cloud system, which is based on the aforementioned engine. The resulting architecture allows devices with totally different and heterogeneous hardware and software characteristics to interact among them, so that these differences are almost completely transparent to the end user.","volume":"Febbraio 2015","journal":"FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS","year":"2015","title":"Cloud-based adaptive compression and secure management services for 3D healthcare data","author":"Castiglione, Arcangelo and Pizzolante, Raffaele and DE SANTIS, Alfredo and Carpentieri, Bruno and Castiglione, Aniello and Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4585057"},{"pages":"408--418","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2015.07.029","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849461500469X","volume":"36","journal":"APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2015","title":"An uncertainty-managing batch relevance-based approach to network anomaly detection","author":"D'Angelo, Gianni and Palmieri, Francesco and Salvatore, R. a. m. p. o. n. e. and Ficco, Massimo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4655321"},{"number":"4","pages":"393--404","doi":"10.3390/fi7040393","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/7/4/393/pdf","keywords":"Data hiding; Digital watermarking; Identity-based cryptography; Computer Networks and Communications","volume":"7","journal":"FUTURE INTERNET","year":"2015","title":"Embedding an identity-based short signature as a digital watermark","author":"Fiore, Ugo and Rossi, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4780497"},{"number":"8","pages":"1464--1478","doi":"10.1016/j.jcss.2014.12.022","volume":"81","journal":"JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES","year":"2015","title":"Modeling energy-efficient secure communications in multi-mode wireless mobile devices","author":"Castiglione, Arcangelo and Palmieri, Francesco and Fiore, Ugo and Castiglione, Aniello and DE SANTIS, Alfredo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4655319"},{"number":"3","pages":"280--291","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2014.2315198","volume":"11","journal":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING","year":"2014","title":"A Denial of Service Attack to UMTS Networks Using SIM-Less Devices","author":"Merlo, A. and Migliardi, M. and Gobbo, N. and Palmieri, Francesco and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646628"},{"pages":"1--7","doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-15-S5-S2","url":"https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-S5-S2","keywords":"Animals; Computational Biology; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Europe; Humans; Software; Algorithms; Computing Methodologies","volume":"15 S2","journal":"BMC BIOINFORMATICS","year":"2014","title":"Towards a HPC-oriented parallel implementation of a learning algorithm for bioinformatics applications","author":"D'Angelo, G. and Rampone, S.","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4771250"},{"number":"2","pages":"271--285","doi":"10.1007/s00779-013-0644-4","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-013-0644-4","booktitle":"Personal and Ubiquitous Computing","volume":"18","journal":"PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING","year":"2014","title":"Hybrid indoor and outdoor location services for new generation mobile terminals","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Palmieri, Francesco and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4202058"},{"number":"4","pages":"737--751","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2013.29","url":"http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TMC.2013.29","keywords":"Calibration; Indoor positioning; RSS fingerprinting","abstract":"Recently, the positioning techniques based on the IEEE 802.11 signal strength are becoming the dominant solutions in the mobile device localization within indoor scenarios. Such solutions are characterized by two main pitfalls that compromise their effective usage in real application environments. First, during the calibration, a large amount of manual effort is required for acquiring a massive collection of training samples. Second, the positioning accuracy is directly related to the deployment of the wireless access points into the workspace, which is extremely time-consuming and requires human intervention. This paper presents an approach to reduce the manual calibration and to optimize the positioning accuracy, by selecting the best deployment schema of the wireless access points. The approach has been implemented in a tool, which uses an analytical signal propagation model to build the radio map of a given workspace, and exploits a multi-objective genetic algorithm to identify the best access points placement pattern that fits the required accuracy.

The system we present can be accessed via portable devices. In many real-world scenarios is useful, or sometimes necessary, to have portable devices that can receive real-time data from a selected camera, to prevent or to manage anomalous activities. The system provides reliable, high speed, secure and real-time communication among all its components, which are the Repository, the Node and the Portable Device. Both Repository and Node can act as a server. The Repository can provide services to both Nodes and Portable Devices, while the Nodes provide services only to the Portable Device. The portable device can only act as a client, using the services offered by the other two parts. In our system, a portable device is assumed to know only the location of the Repository which permits to get the list of nodes connected with one or more camera(s). When a portable device gets the list, it can choose which node intends to connect to, to get the images of its connected camera(s). The security of the interaction among Node-Repository and Node-Portable Device is guaranteed by using the SSL/TLS protocol. The interaction among nodes and portable devices is secured by using an invisible digital watermarking algorithm on each image, before that image is sent from a node to a portable device. The latter extracts the watermark from the image and verifies the identity of the node.","volume":"5","journal":"JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING","year":"2014","title":"Secure and distributed video surveillance via portable devices","author":"Albano, Pietro and Bruno, Andrea and Carpentieri, Bruno and Castiglione, Aniello and Castiglione, Arcangelo and Palmieri, Francesco and Pizzolante, Raffaele and Yim, Kangbin and You, Ilsun","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646670"},{"number":"5","pages":"1113--1129","doi":"10.1002/cpe.3061","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpe.3061","booktitle":"Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience","volume":"26","journal":"CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION","year":"2014","title":"A distributed approach to network anomaly detection based on independent component analysis","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Fiore, Ugo and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4202060"},{"number":"5-6","pages":"1389--1404","doi":"10.1016/j.mcm.2012.12.004","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717712003482","volume":"58","journal":"MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING","year":"2013","title":"Modeling energy consumption in next-generation wireless access-over-WDM networks with hybrid power sources","author":"Sergio, Ricciardi and Palmieri, Francesco and Fiore, Ugo and Castiglione, Aniello and Germ\\'An, Santos Boada","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646648"},{"number":"3","pages":"173--185","doi":"10.1504/IJHPCN.2013.056525","url":"http://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=56525","keywords":"Cloud computing; Complex event processing; Correlation; Intrusion detection; Security","abstract":"Cloud computing is a new business model, which represents an opportunity for users, companies, and public organisations to reduce costs and increase efficiency, as well as an alternative way for providing services and resources.

It consists of detecting intrusion symptoms by collecting diverse information at several cloud architectural levels, using distributed security probes, as well as performing complex event analysis based on a complex event processing engine. The escalation process from intrusion symptoms to the identified cause and target of the intrusion is driven by a knowledge-base represented by an ontology. A prototype implementation of the proposed intrusion detection solution is also presented.","volume":"7","journal":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND NETWORKING","year":"2013","title":"Security event correlation approach for cloud computing","author":"Ficco, Massimo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776195"},{"number":"3","pages":"693--703","doi":"10.1016/j.future.2012.08.004","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X12001604","volume":"29","journal":"FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS","year":"2013","title":"Scalable service discovery in ubiquitous and pervasive computing architectures: A percolation-driven approach","author":"Palmieri, Francesco","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646692"},{"number":"6","pages":"1461--1472","doi":"10.1016/j.future.2013.01.012","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13000289","volume":"29","journal":"FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS","year":"2013","title":"A distributed scheduling framework based on selfish autonomous agents for federated cloud environments","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Luigi, Buonanno and Salvatore, Venticinque and Rocco, Aversa and Beniamino, Di Martino","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646684"},{"number":"1","pages":"615--627","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2012.08.045","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494612004024","volume":"13","journal":"APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING","year":"2013","title":"On the detection of card-sharing traffic through wavelet analysis and Support Vector Machines","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Fiore, Ugo and Castiglione, Aniello and DE SANTIS, Alfredo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4646644"},{"number":"4","pages":"887--903","doi":"10.1007/s10586-013-0261-z","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-013-0261-z","booktitle":"Cluster Computing","volume":"16","journal":"CLUSTER COMPUTING","year":"2013","title":"Interconnecting Federated Clouds by Using Publish-Subscribe Service","author":"Esposito, Christiancarmine and Ficco, Massimo and Palmieri, Francesco and Castiglione, Aniello","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4202057"},{"number":"6","pages":"401--411","keywords":"Cloud; Intrusion detection","abstract":"Cloud Computing paradigm represents an opportunity for users to reduce costs and increase the eciency, providing an alternative way of using services and computational resources. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way, as well as a business model for selling computing resources. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use services and resources on the base of an on-demand, self-service, and pay-by-use business model, implies incredible exibility in terms of management, which is otherwise hard to address. On the other hand, because of this exibility, cyber attacks represent a serious danger, which can compromise performance and availability of the services provided to Cloud consumers. In this paper, we propose an open-source framework for designing distributed Intrusion Detection System for multiple Cloud vendor infrastructures. The proposed framework provides Application Programming Interface and tools to develop multiple probes, which can be dynamically deployed as a distributed architecture. It enables to collect security information at dierent Cloud architectural levels, which can be used to perform event correlation and diagnosis analysis of intrusion in the Cloud-based systems.","volume":"28","journal":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING","year":"2013","title":"An Advanced Intrusion Detection Framework for Cloud Computing","author":"Ficco, Massimo and Venticinque, Salvatore and DI MARTINO, Beniamino","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776143"},{"number":"2","pages":"589--609","doi":"10.2298/CSIS120907025C","url":"http://www.comsis.org/pdf.php?id=imis03-2012","volume":"10","journal":"COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","year":"2013","title":"Using bivariate polynomial to design a dynamic key management scheme for wireless sensor networks","author":"Chen, C.

TDD allows to produce software by iterative and incremental work cycle, and with a strict control over the process, favouring an early detection of bugs. However, when applied to large and complex systems, TDD benets are not so obvious: manually locating and xing bugs introduced during the iterative development steps is a non-trivial task. In such systems, the propagation chains following the bugs activation can be unacceptably long and intricate, and the size of the code to be analyzed is often too large. In this paper, a bug localization technique specically tailored to TDD is presented. The technique is embedded in the TDD cycle and it aims to improve developers' ability to locate bugs as soon as possible. It is implemented in a tool, and experimentally evaluated on newly developed Java programs.","journal":"ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING","year":"2011","title":"Bug Localization in Test-Driven Development","author":"Ficco, M and Pietrantuono, R and Russo, S","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776161"},{"number":"3","pages":"217--239","doi":"10.3233/MIS-2011-0119","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/MIS-2011-0119","volume":"7 / 3","journal":"MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS","year":"2011","title":"Automatic security assessment for next generation wireless mobile networks","author":"Palmieri, Francesco and Ugo, Fiore and Castiglione, Aniello and Fiore, Ugo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_3032029"},{"number":"4","pages":"224--242","doi":"10.1007/s10776-011-0131-7","keywords":"Positioning systems; Propagation model; Optimization solvers","abstract":"Location estimation based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) is the prevalent method in indoor positioning. For such positioning systems, a massive collection of training samples is needed for their calibration. The accuracy of these methods is directly related to the placement of the reference points and the radio map used to compute the device location. Traditionally, deploying the reference points and building the radio map require human intervention and are extremely time-consuming. In this paper we present an approach to reduce the manual calibration efforts needed to deploy an RSS-based localization system, both when using only one RF technology or when using a combination of RF technologies. It is an automatic approach both to build a radio map in a given workspace by means of a signal propagation model, and to assess the system calibration that best fits the required accuracy by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm.","volume":"18","journal":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WIRELESS INFORMATION NETWORKS","year":"2011","title":"Deployment of RSS-Based Indoor Positioning Systems","author":"Esposito, C and Ficco, Massimo","ENTRYTYPE":"article","ID":"11386_4776137"},{"number":"8","pages":"1758--1772","doi":"10.1016/j.simpat.2011.02.005","keywords":"Simulation; Mobile Device; Wireless Network","abstract":"Position represents a relevant attribute needed by many applications, whose contexts are characterized by pervasiveness of the objects/things in the considered scenarios.

The current interworking between the third-generation systems and the wireless networks, along with the spreading of the new mobile devices equipped with multi location sensing technologies, pave the ground to new and more favourable services. Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) need to take into account several elements for ensuring valuable LBSs. The adopted location platforms should be able to leverage the different features of the wireless networks and of the existing positioning techniques in order to always provide ubiquitous LBSs with high accuracy across heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the adopted platform architecture and its protocols need to be carefully designed for providing highly scalable and interoperable services. For instance, the use of open standards can favourWISPs interoperability and hence multi-vendors LBSs integration. We first present the elements involved in high-quality LBSs provisioning. Then a possible two-tier open-standard based architecture for inferring and exchanging indoor and outdoor location information through heterogeneous wireless networks is presented.
